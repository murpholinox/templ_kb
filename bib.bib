abstract = {Bacteriorhodopsin, the sole membrane protein of the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum, functions as a light-driven proton pump. A 3-D crystal of bacteriorhodopsin, which was prepared by the membrane fusion method, was used to investigate structural changes in the primary photoreaction. It was observed that when a frozen crystal was exposed to a low flux of X-ray radiation (5 × 1014 photons mm-2), nearly half of the protein was converted into an orange species, exhibiting absorption peaks at 450 nm, 478 nm and 510 nm. The remainder retained the normal photochemical activity until Asp85 in the active site was decarboxlyated by a higher flux of X-ray radiation (1016 photons mm-2). The procedure of diffraction measurement was improved so as to minimize the effects of the radiation damage and determine the true structural change associated with the primary photoreaction. Our structural model of the K intermediate indicates that the Schiff base linkage and the adjacent bonds in the polyene chain of retinal are largely twisted so that the Schiff base nitrogen atom still interacts with a water molecule located near Asp85. With respect to the other part of the protein, no appreciable displacement is induced in the primary photoreaction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The traditional approaches for diffraction data collection have emphasised collecting data from noisy integrating detectors (i.e. film, image plates and CCD detectors). With fast pixel array detectors on stable beamlines, the limiting factor becomes the sample lifetime, and the question becomes one of how to expend the photons that your sample can diffract, i.e. as a smaller number of stronger measurements or a larger number of weaker data. This parameter space is explored via experiment and synthetic data treatment and advice is derived on how best to use the equipment on a modern beamline. Suggestions are also made on how to acquire data in a conservative manner if very little is known about the sample lifetime.},

abstract = {Radiation damage restricts the useful lifetime for macromolecular crystals in the X-ray beam, even at cryotemperatures. With the development of structural genomics pipelines, it will be essential to incorporate projected crystal lifetime information into the automated data collection software routines. As a first step towards this goal, a computer program, RADDOSE, is presented which is designed for use by crystallographers in optimizing the amount of data that can be obtained from a particular cryo-cooled crystal at synchrotron beamlines. The program uses the composition of the crystal and buffer constituents, as well as the beam energy, flux and dimensions, to compute the absorption coefficients and hence the theoretical time taken to reach an absorbed dose of 2 × 107 Gy, the so-called 'Henderson limit'. At this dose, the intensity of the diffraction pattern is predicted to be halved. A 'diffraction-dose efficiency' quantity is introduced, for the convenient comparison of absorbed dose per diffracted photon for different crystals. Four example cases are considered, and the implications for anomalous data collection are discussed in the light of the results from RADDOSE.},

An overview of the main directions of these developments and examples of specific solutions available to the macromolecular crystallography community are presented in this paper, showing that data collection 'at home' is still an attractive proposition complementing the use of synchrotron beamlines.},

abstract = {Crystallography is commonly used for studying the structures of protein-protein complexes. However, a crystal structure does not define a unique protein-protein interface, and distinguishing a 'biological interface' from 'crystal contacts' is often not straightforward. A number of computational approaches exist for distinguishing them, but their error rate is high, emphasizing the need to obtain further data on the biological interface using complementary structural and functional approaches. In addition to reviewing the computational and experimental approaches for addressing this problem, we highlight two relevant examples. The first example from our laboratory involves the structure of acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, where each domain of this two-domain protein was crystallized separately, but both yielded a non-functional assembly. The structure of the full-length protein was uncovered using a combination of complementary approaches including chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation and mutagenesis. The second example involves the platelet glycoprotein Ib$\alpha$-thrombin complex. Two groups reported the crystal structures of this complex, but all the interacting interfaces differed between the two structures. Our computational analysis did not fully resolve the reasons for the discrepancies, but provided interesting insights into the system. This review highlights the need to complement crystallographic studies with complementary experimental and computational approaches. {\textcopyright} 2008 Biochemical Society.},

Hydroxyl radicals are shown to be trapped in amorphous solutions at 100 K.

The observation of a similar effect in all three systems provides clear evidence for a common optimal strategy for room-temperature data collection and will inform the design of future synchrotron beamlines and detectors for macro-molecular crystallography. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Union of Crystallography.

Here, we assess samples of bones obtained from fatal victims of the explosion by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). In 1973, one of the authors of the present study (SM) traveled to Japan and conducted a preliminary experiment on the victims' bone samples. The idea was to use the paramagnetism induced in bone after irradiation to measure the radiation dose. Technological advances involved in the construction of spectrometers, better knowledge of the paramagnetic center, and improvement in signal processing techniques have allowed us to resume the investigation. We obtained a reconstructed dose of 9.46 ± 3.4 Gy from the jawbone, which was compatible with the dose distribution in different locations as measured in non-biological materials such as wall bricks and roof tiles.},

@article{Liebschner2013,
abstract = {Structural studies of proteins usually rely on a model obtained from one crystal. By investigating the details of this model, crystallographers seek to obtain insight into the function of the macromolecule. It is therefore important to know which details of a protein structure are reproducible or to what extent they might differ. To address this question, the high-resolution structures of five crystals of bovine trypsin obtained under analogous conditions were compared. Global parameters and structural details were investigated. All of the models were of similar quality and the pairwise merged intensities had large correlation coefficients. The C$\alpha$ and backbone atoms of the structures superposed very well. The occupancy of ligands in regions of low thermal motion was reproducible, whereas solvent molecules containing heavier atoms (such as sulfur) or those located on the surface could differ significantly. The coordination lengths of the calcium ion were conserved. A large proportion of the multiple conformations refined to similar occupancies and the residues adopted similar orientations. More than three quarters of the water-molecule sites were conserved within 0.5 {\AA} and more than one third were conserved within 0.1 {\AA}. An investigation of the protonation states of histidine residues and carboxylate moieties was consistent for all of the models. Radiation-damage effects to disulfide bridges were observed for the same residues and to similar extents. Main-chain bond lengths and angles averaged to similar values and were in agreement with the Engh and Huber targets. Other features, such as peptide flips and the double conformation of the inhibitor molecule, were also reproducible in all of the trypsin structures. Therefore, many details are similar in models obtained from different crystals. However, several features of residues or ligands located in flexible parts of the macromolecule may vary significantly, such as side-chain orientations and the occupancies of certain fragments. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {The human mind innately excels at some complex tasks that are difficult to solve using computers alone. For complex problems amenable to parallelization, strategies can be developed to exploit human intelligence in a collective form: such approaches are sometimes referred to as `crowdsourcing'. Here, a first attempt at a crowdsourced approach for low-resolution ab initio phasing in macromolecular crystallography is proposed. A collaborative online game named CrowdPhase was designed, which relies on a human-powered genetic algorithm, where players control the selection mechanism during the evolutionary process. The algorithm starts from a population of `individuals', each with a random genetic makeup, in this case a map prepared from a random set of phases, and tries to cause the population to evolve towards individuals with better phases based on Darwinian survival of the fittest. Players apply their pattern-recognition capabilities to evaluate the electron-density maps generated from these sets of phases and to select the fittest individuals. A user-friendly interface, a training stage and a competitive scoring system foster a network of well trained players who can guide the genetic algorithm towards better solutions from generation to generation via gameplay. CrowdPhase was applied to two synthetic low-resolution phasing puzzles and it was shown that players could successfully obtain phase sets in the 30° phase error range and corresponding molecular envelopes showing agreement with the low-resolution models. The successful preliminary studies suggest that with further development the crowdsourcing approach could fill a gap in current crystallographic methods by making it possible to extract meaningful information in cases where limited resolution might otherwise prevent initial phasing.},

abstract = {Improvements in crystallographic hardware and software have allowed automated structure-solution pipelines to approach a near-`one-click' experience for the initial determination of macromolecular structures. However, in many cases the resulting initial model requires a laborious, iterative process of refinement and validation. A new method has been developed for the automatic modeling of side-chain conformations that takes advantage of rotamer-prediction methods in a crystallographic context. The algorithm, which is based on deterministic dead-end elimination (DEE) theory, uses new dense conformer libraries and a hybrid energy function derived from experimental data and prior information about rotamer frequencies to find the optimal conformation of each side chain. In contrast to existing methods, which incorporate the electron-density term into protein-modeling frameworks, the proposed algorithm is designed to take advantage of the highly discriminatory nature of electron-density maps. This method has been implemented in the program Fitmunk , which uses extensive conformational sampling. This improves the accuracy of the modeling and makes it a versatile tool for crystallographic model building, refinement and validation. Fitmunk was extensively tested on over 115 new structures, as well as a subset of 1100 structures from the PDB. It is demonstrated that the ability of Fitmunk to model more than 95{\%} of side chains accurately is beneficial for improving the quality of crystallographic protein models, especially at medium and low resolutions. Fitmunk can be used for model validation of existing structures and as a tool to assess whether side chains are modeled optimally or could be better fitted into electron density. Fitmunk is available as a web service at http://kniahini.med.virginia.edu/fitmunk/server/ or at http://fitmunk.bitbucket.org/.},

We find that noise varies with position and is often six to eight times lower than thresholds currently used in model building. Analyzing the rescaled electron density maps from 485 representative proteins revealed unmodeled conformations above the estimated noise for 45{\%} of side chains and a previously hidden, low-occupancy inhibitor of HIV capsid protein. Comparing the electron density maps in the free and nucleotide-bound structures of three human protein kinases suggested that substrate binding perturbs distinct intrinsic allosteric networks that link the active site to surfaces that recognize regulatory proteins. These results illustrate general approaches to identify and analyze alternative conformations, low-occupancy small molecules, solvent distributions, communication pathways, and protein motions.},

@article{Yang1993,
abstract = {This paper treats the free energy contribution of ionizable groups to protein stability. A method is presented for the calculation of the pH dependence of the denaturation free energy of a protein, which yields results that can be compared directly to experiment. The first step in the treatment is the determination of the average charges of all the ionizable groups in both the folded and unfolded protein. An expression due to Tanford then relates the pH dependence of the unfolding free energy to the difference in net charge between the two states. In order to determine absolute rather than relative unfolding free energies, it is necessary to calculate the total contribution of ionizable groups to protein stability at some reference pH. This is accomplished through a statistical mechanical treatment similar to the one used previously in the calculation of pKas. The treatment itself is rigorous but it suffers from uncertainties in the pKa calculations. Nevertheless, the overall shape of experimentally observed plots of denaturation free energy as a function of pH are reasonably well reproduced by the calculations. A number of general conclusions that arise from the analysis are: (1) knowledge of titration curves and/or effective pKa values of ionizable groups in proteins is sufficient to calculate the pH dependence of the denaturation free energy with respect to some reference pH value. However, in order to calculate the absolute contribution of ionizable groups to protein stability, it is necessary to also know the intrinsic pKa, of each group. This is defined as the pKa of a group in a hypothetical state of the protein where all other groups are neutral. (2) Due to desolvation effects, ionizable groups destabilize proteins, although the effect is strongly dependent on pH. There are however, strongly stabilizing pairwise Coulombic interactions on the surface of proteins. (3) Plots of stability versus pH should not be interpreted in terms of a group whose pKa corresponds to the titration midpoint, but rather to a group with different pKas (that correspond approximately to the titration end points) in each state. (4) Any residual structure in the GuHCl-denatured state of proteins appears to have little effect on the pH dependence of stability. (5) pH-dependent unfolding, for example to the “molten globule„ state, appears due to individual groups with anomalous pKas whose locations on the protein surface may determine the nature of the unfolded state. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {A method for calculating the absolute electrostatic free energy of a titrating system as a function of pH is proposed, and a concise formula for the free energy is presented. Based on the theory of linked functions, the electrostatic free energy is calculated by integration of the titration curve. The approach uses pH = ∞, at which the system is in the unprotonated state, as the reference pH for the integration. The finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann method is used for the electrostatic free energy, and the titration curve is obtained by the Monte Carlo approach of Beroza et al.1 The method is applied to the native and denatured state of hen egg-white lysozyme in aqueous solution. A dielectric constant of 20 is assigned to the protein interior, in accord with the work of Antosiewicz et al.2 X-ray structures are used for the native state, and an extended $\beta$-structure is used for the unfolded reference state; good agreement with experiment is obtained. Comparison of the results for the extended $\beta$-structure and for a "null" model of noninteracting sites for the unfolded state shows significant differences. This indicates that there are important interactions between titrating sites in the unfolded state, in agreement with recent experimental estimates by Oliveberg et al.3 A number of structures obtained by in vacuo minimization of the native and unfolded protein are compared, and it is shown that the absolute pH-stability curve has a strong conformational dependence, although the relative stability curve does not. Calculations of absolute free energy differences, rather than relative changes as a function of pH, are of general interest; for example, they can be used to study the binding energy of ligands involving small titratable compounds.},

abstract = {Understanding protein stability is a significant challenge requiring characterization of interactions within both folded and unfolded states. Of these, electrostatic interactions influence ionization equilibria of acidic and basic groups and diversify their pKa values. The pH dependence of the thermodynamic stability $\Delta$GFU) of a protein arises as a consequence of differential pKa values between folded and unfolded states. Previous attempts to calculate pH-dependent contributions to stability have been limited by the lack of experimental unfolded state pKa values. Using recently developed NMR spectroscopic methods, we have determined residue-specific pKa values for a thermodynamically unstable Src homology 3 domain in both states, enabling the calculation of the pH dependence of stability based on simple analytical expressions. The calculated pH stability profile obtained agrees very well with experiment, unlike profiles derived from two current models of electrostatic interactions within unfolded states. Most importantly, per-residue contributions to the pH dependence of $\Delta$GFU derived from the data provide insights into specific electrostatic interactions in both the folded and unfolded states and their roles in protein stability. These interactions include a hydrogen bond between the Asp-8 side-chain and the Lys-21 backbone amide group in the folded state, which represents a highly conserved interaction in Src homology 3 domains.},

The experimental data for the pH of maximal stability (experimental optimum pH) was reproducible (rmsd = 0.73). It was shown that the optimum pH results from two factors - amino acid composition and the organization of the titratable groups with the 3D structure. It was demonstrated that the optimum pH and isoelectric point could be quite different. In many cases, the optimum pH was found at a pH corresponding to a large net charge of the protein. At the same time, there was a tendency for proteins having acidic optimum pHs to have a base/acid ratio smaller than one and vice versa. The correlation between the optimum pH and base/acid ratio is significant if only buried groups are taken into account. It was shown that a protein that provides a favorable electrostatic environment for acids and disfavors the bases tends to have high optimum pH and vice versa.},

abstract = {The importance of charge-charge interactions in the thermal stability of proteins is widely known. pH and ionic strength play a crucial role in these electrostatic interactions, as well as in the arrangement of ionizable residues in each protein-folding stage. In this study, two coarse-grained models were used to evaluate the effect of pH and salt concentration on the thermal stability of a protein G variant (1PGB-QDD), which was chosen due to the quantity of experimental data exploring these effects on its stability. One of these coarse-grained models, the TKSA, calculates the electrostatic free energy of the protein in the native state via the Tanford-Kirkwood approach for each residue. The other one, CpHMD-SBM, uses a Coulomb screening potential in addition to the structure-based model C$\alpha$. Both models simulate the system in constant pH. The comparison between the experimental stability analysis and the computational results obtained by these simple models showed a good agreement. Through the TKSA method, the role of each charged residue in the protein's thermal stability was inferred. Using CpHMD-SBM, it was possible to evaluate salt and pH effects throughout the folding process. Finally, the computational pKa values were calculated by both methods and presented a good level of agreement with the experiments. This study provides, to our knowledge, new information and a comprehensive description of the electrostatic contribution to protein G stability.},

abstract = {The acid-base behavior of amino acids is an important subject of study due to their prominent role in enzyme catalysis, substrate binding and protein structure. Due to interactions with the protein environment, their pKas can be shifted from their solution values and, if a protein has two stable conformations, it is possible for a residue to have different "microscopic", conformation-dependent pKa values. In those cases, interpretation of experimental measurements of the pKa is complicated by the coupling between pH, protonation state and protein conformation. We explored these issues using Nitrophorin 4 (NP4), a protein that releases NO in a pH sensitive manner. At pH 5.5 NP4 is in a closed conformation where NO is tightly bound, while at pH 7.5 Asp30 becomes deprotonated, causing the conformation to change to an open state from which NO can easily escape. Using constant pH molecular dynamics we found two distinct microscopic Asp30 pKas: 8.5 in the closed structure and 4.3 in the open structure. Using a four-state model, we then related the obtained microscopic values to the experimentally observed "apparent" pKa, obtaining a value of 6.5, in excellent agreement with experimental data. This value must be interpreted as the pH at which the closed to open population transition takes place. More generally, our results show that it is possible to relate microscopic structure dependent pKa values to experimentally observed ensemble dependent apparent pKas and that the insight gained in the relatively simple case of NP4 can be useful in several more complex cases involving a pH dependent transition, of great biochemical interest. {\textcopyright} 2012 Di Russo et al.},

abstract = {Methods for the calculation of the pKa ionizable amino acids are valuable tools for understanding pH-dependent properties of proteins. Cysteine is unique among the amino acids because of the chemical reactivity of its thiol group (S-H), which plays an instrumental role in several biochemical and regulatory functions. The acidity of noncatalytic cysteine residues is a factor in their susceptibility to chemical modification. Despite the plethora of existing pKa computing methods, no definitive protocol exists for accurately calculating the pKa's of cysteine residues in proteins. A cysteine pKa test set was developed, which is comprised of 18 cysteine residues in 12 proteins where the pKa's have been determined experimentally and an experimental structure is available. The pKa's of these residues were calculated using three methods that use an implicit solvent model (H++, MCCE, and PROPKA) and an all-atom replica-exchange thermodynamic integration approach with the CHARMM36 and AMBER ff99SB-ILDNP force fields. The models that use implicit solvation methods were generally unreliable in predicting cysteine residue pKa's, with RMSDs between 3.41 and 4.72 pKa units. On average, the explicit solvent methods performed better than the implicit solvent methods. RMSD values of 2.40 and 3.20 were obtained for simulations with the CHARMM36 and AMBER ff99SB-ILDNP force fields, respectively. Further development of these methods is necessary because the performance of the best method is similar to that of the null-model (RMSD = 2.74) and these differences in RMSD are of limited statistical significance given the small size of our test set.},

abstract = {We describe what may be the most accurate approach currently available for the calculation of the pKas of ionizable groups in proteins. The accuracy is assessed by comparison of computed pKas with 60 measured pKas in a total of seven proteins. The overall root-mean-square error is 0.89 pKa units. Linear regression analysis of computed versus measured pKas yields a slope of 0.95, y-intercept of −0.02 and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. The proposed approach also picks out many of the shifted pKas of groups in enzyme active sites and special salt bridges. However, it does yield several over-shifted pKas and tends to underestimate pKa shifts which result from desolvation effects. We examine the ability of the new approach to reproduce the dependence of protein stability upon pH, using the ionization polynomial formalism. Overall features of the stability curves are reproduced, but the quantitative agreement is not particularly good. The reasons for the disagreement may have to do both with insufficient accuracy in the theory and with uncertainty in the nature of the unfolded state of proteins. The methodology described here is based upon finite difference solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Its success depends upon the use of the rather high protein dielectric constant of 20. However, theoretical considerations and the fact that pKa shifts which result from desolvation are underestimated here imply that the dielectric constant of the protein interior actually is lower than 20. We suggest that the high protein dielectric constant improves the overall agreement with experiment because it accounts approximately for phenomena which tend to mitigate pKa shifts and which are not specifically included in the model. These include conformational relaxation and specific ion-binding. Future models based upon a low protein dielectric constant and treating such phenomena explicitly might yield improved agreement with experiment. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Methods for estimation of pKa values of residues in proteins were tested on a set of benchmark proteins with experimentally known pK a values. The benchmark set includes 80 different residues (20 each for Asp, Glu, Lys, and His), half of which consists of significantly variant cases ($\Delta$pKa ≥ 1 pKa unit from the amino acid in solution). The method introduced by Case and co-workers [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 4167-4180], referred to as the molecular dynamics/generalized-Born/ thermodynamic integration (MD/GB/TI) technique, gives a root-meansquare deviation (rmsd) of 1.4 pKa units on the benchmark set. The use of explicit waters in the immediate region surrounding the residue was shown to generally reduce high errors for this method. Longer simulation time was also shown to increase the accuracy of this method. The empirical approach developed by Jensen and co-workers [Proteins 2005, 61, 704-721], PROPKA, also gives an overall rmsd of 1.4 pKa units and is more or less accurate based on residue type-the method does very well for Lys and Glu, but less so for Asp and His. Likewise, the absolute deviation is quite similar for the two methods-5.2 for PROPKA and 5.1 for MD/ GB/TI. A comparison of these results with several prediction methods from the literature is presented. The error in pKa prediction is analyzed as a function of variation of the pKa from that in water and the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the residue. A case study of the catalytic lysine residue in 2-deoxyhbose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

(2) How can conformational flexibility of proteins best be accounted for? (3) Will use of solution structures in the calculations, rather than crystal structures, improve the accuracy of the computed pKas? and (4) Why does accurate prediction of protein pKas seem to require that a high dielectric constant be assigned to the protein interior? This paper addresses these and related issues. Among the conclusions are the following: (1) computed pKas averaged over NMR structure sets are more accurate than those based upon single crystal structures; (2) use of atomic parameters optimized to reproduce hydration energies of small molecules improves agreement with experiment when a low protein dielectric constant is assumed; (3) despite use of NMR structures and optimized atomic parameters, pKas computed with a protein dielectric constant of 20 are more accurate than those computed with a low protein dielectric constant; (4) the pKa shifts in ribonuclease A that result from phosphate binding are reproduced reasonably well by calculations; (5) the substantial pKa shifts observed in turkey ovomucoid third domain result largely from interactions among ionized groups; and (6) both experimental data and calculations indicate that proteins tend to lower the pKas of Asp side chains but have little overall effect upon the pKas of other ionizable groups.},

Although computational algorithms have been developed for calculating everything from the dynamics of a protein to its binding specificity, only limited information is available on the ability of these methods to give accurate results when used with a particular X-ray structure. We examine the ability of a pKa calculation algorithm to predict the proton-donating residue in the catalytic mechanism of hen egg white lysozyme. We examine the correlation between the ability of the pKa calculation method to obtain the correct result and the overall characteristics of 41 X-ray structures such as crystallization conditions, resolution, and the output of structure validation software. We furthermore examine the ability of energy minimizations (EM), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and structure-perturbation methods to optimize the X-ray structures such that these give correct results with the pKa calculation algorithm. We propose a set of criteria for identifying the proton donor in a catalytic mechanism, and demonstrate that the application of these criteria give highly accurate prediction results when using unmodified X-ray structures. More specifically, we are able to successfully identify the proton donor in 85{\%} of the X-ray structures when excluding structures with crystal contacts near the active site. Neither the use of the overall characteristics of the X-ray structures nor the optimization of the structure by EM, MD, or other methods improves the results of the pKa calculation algorithm. We discuss these results and their implications for the design of structure-based energy calculation algorithms in general.},

Two novel features were utilized: the dielectric properties of the macromolecules and water phase were modeled via the smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function in DelPhi and the corresponding electrostatic energies were calculated without defining the molecular surface. We tested the algorithm by calculating pKa values for more than 300 residues from 32 proteins from the PPD dataset and achieved an overall RMSD of 0.77. Particularly, the RMSD of 0.55 was achieved for surface residues, while the RMSD of 1.1 for buried residues. The approach was also found capable of capturing the large pKa shifts of various single point mutations in staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) from pKa-cooperative dataset, resulting in an overall RMSD of 1.6 for this set of pKa's. Investigations showed that predictions for most of buried mutant residues of SNase could be improved by using higher dielectric constant values. Furthermore, an option to generate different hydrogen positions also improves pKa predictions for buried carboxyl residues. Finally, the pKa calculations on two RNAs demonstrated the capability of this approach for other types of biomolecules.},

@article{Nave2020,
abstract = {X-ray imaging of soft materials is often difficult because of the low contrast of the components. This particularly applies to frozen hydrated biological cells where the feature of interest can have a similar density to the surroundings. As a consequence, a high dose is often required to achieve the desired resolution. However, the maximum dose that a specimen can tolerate is limited by radiation damage. Results from 3D coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of frozen hydrated specimens have given resolutions of ∼80 nm compared with the expected resolution of 10 nm predicted from theoretical considerations for identifying a protein embedded in water. Possible explanations for this include the inapplicability of the dose-fractionation theorem, the difficulty of phase determination, an overall object-size dependence on the required fluence and dose, a low contrast within the biological cell, insufficient exposure, and a variety of practical difficulties such as scattering from surrounding material. A recent article [Villaneuva-Perez et al. (2018), Optica , 5 , 450–457] concluded that imaging by Compton scattering gave a large dose advantage compared with CDI because of the object-size dependence for CDI. An object-size dependence would severely limit the applicability of CDI and perhaps related coherence-based methods for structural studies. This article specifically includes the overall object size in the analysis of the fluence and dose requirements for coherent imaging in order to investigate whether there is a dependence on object size. The applicability of the dose-fractionation theorem is also discussed. The analysis is extended to absorption-based imaging and imaging by incoherent scattering (Compton) and fluorescence. This article includes analysis of the dose required for imaging specific low-contrast cellular organelles as well as for protein against water. This article concludes that for both absorption-based and coherent diffraction imaging, the dose-fractionation theorem applies and the required dose is independent of the overall size of the object. For incoherent-imaging methods such as Compton scattering, the required dose depends on the X-ray path length through the specimen. For all three types of imaging, the dependence of fluence and dose on a resolution d goes as 1/ d 4 when imaging uniform-density voxels. The independence of CDI on object size means that there is no advantage for Compton scattering over coherent-based imaging methods. The most optimistic estimate of achievable resolution is 3 nm for imaging protein molecules in water/ice using lensless imaging methods in the water window. However, the attainable resolution depends on a variety of assumptions including the model for radiation damage as a function of resolution, the efficiency of any phase-retrieval process, the actual contrast of the feature of interest within the cell and the definition of resolution itself. There is insufficient observational information available regarding the most appropriate model for radiation damage in frozen hydrated biological material. It is advocated that, in order to compare theory with experiment, standard methods of reporting results covering parameters such as the feature examined ( e.g. which cellular organelle), resolution, contrast, depth of the material (for 2D), estimate of noise and dose should be adopted.},

Such a predictive tool can rapidly assess the usefulness of data and guide the collection of an optimal data set. The increase in data rates from modern macromolecular crystallography beamlines, together with a demand from users for real-time feedback, has led to pressure on computational resources and a need for smarter data handling. Statistical and machine-learning methods have been applied to construct a classifier that displays 95{\%} accuracy for training and testing data sets compiled from 440 solved structures. Applying this classifier to new data achieved 79{\%} accuracy. These scores already provide clear guidance as to the effective use of computing resources and offer a starting point for a personalized data-collection assistant.},

abstract = {The crystallographic maps that are routinely used during the structure-solution workflow are almost always model-biased because model information is used for their calculation. As these maps are also used to validate the atomic models that result from model building and refinement, this constitutes an immediate problem: anything added to the model will manifest itself in the map and thus hinder the validation. OMIT maps are a common tool to verify the presence of atoms in the model. The simplest way to compute an OMIT map is to exclude the atoms in question from the structure, update the corresponding structure factors and compute a residual map. It is then expected that if these atoms are present in the crystal structure, the electron density for the omitted atoms will be seen as positive features in this map. This, however, is complicated by the flat bulk-solvent model which is almost universally used in modern crystallographic refinement programs. This model postulates constant electron density at any voxel of the unit-cell volume that is not occupied by the atomic model. Consequently, if the density arising from the omitted atoms is weak then the bulk-solvent model may obscure it further. A possible solution to this problem is to prevent bulk solvent from entering the selected OMIT regions, which may improve the interpretative power of residual maps. This approach is called a polder (OMIT) map. Polder OMIT maps can be particularly useful for displaying weak densities of ligands, solvent molecules, side chains, alternative conformations and residues both in terminal regions and in loops. The tools described in this manuscript have been implemented and are available in PHENIX .},

In this study, the effects of the buffer and protein solution pH values on the results of screening are systematically investigated. It was found that these parameters significantly affected the results and thus the following strategy for the selection of appropriate pH values is proposed: (i) when screening with only one protein solution, the pH should be as low, as high or as divergent from the pI as possible for a basic, acidic or neutral protein, respectively, within its stable pH range; (ii) when screening with two protein solutions, the pH values should be well separated from one another; and (iii) when multiple pH values are utilized, an even distribution of pH values is the best approach to increase the success rate of crystallization. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In an X-ray diffraction experiment, the structure of molecules and the crystal lattice changes owing to chemical reactions and physical processes induced by the absorption of X-ray photons. These structural changes alter structure factors, affecting the scaling and merging of data collected at different absorbed doses. Many crystallographic procedures rely on the analysis of consistency between symmetry-equivalent reflections, so failure to account for the drift of their intensities hinders the structure solution and the interpretation of structural results. The building of a conceptual model of radiation-induced changes in macromolecular crystals is the first step in the process of correcting for radiation-induced inconsistencies in diffraction data. Here the complexity of radiation-induced changes in real and reciprocal space is analysed using matrix singular value decomposition applied to multiple complete datasets obtained from single crystals. The model consists of a resolution-dependent decay correction and a uniform-per-unique-reflection term modelling specific radiation-induced changes. This model is typically sufficient to explain radiation-induced effects observed in diffraction intensities. This analysis will guide the parameterization of the model, enabling its use in subsequent crystallographic calculations.},

@article{Kurgan2009,
abstract = {Background. Current protocols yield crystals for {\textless}30{\%} of known proteins, indicating that automatically identifying crystallizable proteins may improve high-throughput structural genomics efforts. We introduce CRYSTALP2, a kernel-based method that predicts the propensity of a given protein sequence to produce diffraction-quality crystals. This method utilizes the composition and collocation of amino acids, isoelectric point, and hydrophobicity, as estimated from the primary sequence, to generate predictions. CRYSTALP2 extends its predecessor, CRYSTALP, by enabling predictions for sequences of unrestricted size and provides improved prediction quality. Results. A significant majority of the collocations used by CRYSTALP2 include residues with high conformational entropy, or low entropy and high potential to mediate crystal contacts; notably, such residues are utilized by surface entropy reduction methods. We show that the collocations provide complementary information to the hydrophobicity and isoelectric point. Tests on four datasets show that CRYSTALP2 outperforms several existing sequence-based predictors (CRYSTALP, OB-score, and SECRET). CRYSTALP2's accuracy, MCC, and AROC range between 69.3 and 77.5{\%}, 0.39 and 0.55, and 0.72 and 0.79, respectively. Our predictions are similar in quality and are complementary to the predictions of the most recent ParCrys and XtalPred methods. Our results also suggest that, as work in protein crystallization continues (thereby enlarging the population of proteins with known crystallization propensities), the prediction quality of the CRYSTALP2 method should increase. The prediction model and the datasets used in this contribution can be downloaded from http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/CRYSTALP2/CRYSTALP2.html. Conclusion. CRYSTALP2 provides relatively accurate crystallization propensity predictions for a given protein chain that either outperform or complement the existing approaches. The proposed method can be used to support current efforts towards improving the success rate in obtaining diffraction-quality crystals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Kurgan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Packing contacts are crystal artifacts, yet they make use of the same forces that govern specific recognition in protein‐protein complexes and oligomeric proteins. They provide examples of a nonspecific protein‐protein interaction which can be compared to biologically relevant ones. We evaluate the number and size of pairwise interfaces in 152 crystal forms where the asymmetric unit contains a monomeric protein. In those crystal forms that have no element of 2‐fold symmetry, we find that molecules form 8 to 10 pairwise interfaces. The total area of the surface buried on each molecule is large, up to 4400 {\AA}2. Pairwise interfaces bury 200–1200 {\AA}2, like interfaces generated at random in a computer simulation, and less than interfaces in protease‐inhibitor or antigen‐antibody complexes, which bury 1500 {\AA}2 or more. Thus, specific contacts occurring in such complexes extend over a larger surface than nonspecific ones. In crystal forms with 2‐fold symmetry, pairwise interfaces are fewer and larger on average than in the absence of 2‐fold symmetry. Some bury 1500–2500 {\AA}2, like interfaces in oligomeric proteins, and create “crystal oligomers” which may have formed in the solution before crystallizing. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {The common goal for structural genomic centers and consortiums is to decipher as quickly as possible the three-dimensional structures for a multitude of recombinant proteins derived from known genomic sequences. Since X-ray crystallography is the foremost method to acquire atomic resolution for macromolecules, the limiting step is obtaining protein crystals that can be useful of structure determination. High-throughput methods have been developed in recent years to clone, express, purify, crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein gene product rapidly using automated devices, commercialized kits and consolidated protocols. However, the average number of protein structures obtained for most structural genomic groups has been very low compared to the total number of proteins purified. As more entire genomic sequences are obtained for different organisms from the three kingdoms of life, only the proteins that can be crystallized and whose structures can be obtained easily are studied. Consequently, an astonishing number of genomic proteins remain unexamined. In the era of high-throughput processes, traditional methods in molecular biology, protein chemistry and crystallization are eclipsed by automation and pipeline practices. The necessity for high-rate production of protein crystals and structures has prevented the usage of more intellectual strategies and creative approaches in experimental executions. Fundamental principles and personal experiences in protein chemistry and crystallization are minimally exploited only to obtain "low-hanging fruit" protein structures. We review the practical aspects of today's high-throughput manipulations and discuss the challenges in fast pace protein crystallization and tools for crystallography. Structural genomic pipelines can be improved with information gained from low-throughput tactics that may help us reach the higher-bearing fruits.

abstract = {A new strategy is presented to reduce primary X-ray damage in macromolecular crystallography. The strategy is based on separating the diffracting and damaged regions as much as feasible. The source of the radiation damage to macromolecular crystals is from two primary mechanisms: the direct excitations of electrons by absorption, and inelastic scattering of the X-rays. The first produces photoelectrons with their accompanying Auger electrons from relaxation of the core hole and the second creates Compton electrons. The properties of these two mechanisms and calculations of primary X-ray damage quantify how to modify the spatial distribution of X-rays to reduce the deleterious effects of radiation damage. By focusing the incident X-rays into vertical stripes, it is estimated that the survival (the time during which quality diffraction data can be obtained with a given X-ray flux) of large crystals can be increased by at least a factor of 1.6, while for very small platelet crystals the survival can be increased by up to a factor of 14. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rate of radiation damage to macromolecular crystals at both room temperature and 100 K has previously been shown to be reduced by the use of certain radical scavengers. Here the effects of sodium nitrate, an electron scavenger, are investigated at 100 K. For sodium nitrate at a concentration of 0.5 M in chicken egg-white lysozyme crystals, the dose tolerance is increased by a factor of two as judged from the global damage parameters, and no specific structural damage to the disulfide bonds is seen until the dose is greatly in excess (more than a factor of five) of the value at which damage appears in electron density maps derived from a scavenger-free crystal. In the electron density maps, ordered nitrate ions adjacent to the disulfide bonds are seen to lose an O atom, and appear to protect the disulfide bonds. In addition, results reinforcing previous reports on the effectiveness of ascorbate are presented. The mechanisms of action of both scavengers in the crystalline environment are elucidated.},

abstract = {Recent studies have defined a data-collection protocol and a metric that provide a robust measure of global radiation damage to protein crystals. Using this protocol and metric, 19 small-molecule compounds (introduced either by cocrystalliz-ation or soaking) were evaluated for their ability to protect lysozyme crystals from radiation damage. The compounds were selected based upon their ability to interact with radiolytic products (e.g. hydrated electrons, hydrogen, hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals) and/or their efficacy in protecting biological molecules from radiation damage in dilute aqueous solutions. At room temperature, 12 compounds ha d no effect and six had a sensitizing effect on global damage. Only one compound, sodium nitrate, appeared to extend crystal lifetimes, but not in all proteins and only by a factor of two or less. No compound provided protection at T = 100 K. Scavengers are ineffective in protecting protein crystals from global damage because a large fraction of primary X-ray-induced excitations are generated in and/or directly attack the protein and because the ratio of scavenger molecules to protein molecules is too small to provide appreciable competitive protection. The same reactivity that makes some scavengers effective radioprotectors in protein solutions may explain their sensitizing effect in the protein-dense environment of a crystal. A more productive focus for future efforts may be to identify and eliminate sensitizing compounds from crystallization solutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.

abstract = {A series of studies that provide a consistent and illuminating picture of global radiation damage to protein crystals, especially at temperatures above ∼200 K, are described. The radiation sensitivity shows a transition near 200 K, above which it appears to be limited by solvent-coupled diffusive processes. Consistent with this interpretation, a component of global damage proceeds on timescales of several minutes at 180 K, decreasing to seconds near room temperature. As a result, data collection times of order 1 s allow up to half of global damage to be outrun at 260 K. Much larger damage reductions near room temperature should be feasible using larger dose rates delivered using microfocused beams, enabling a significant expansion of structural studies of proteins under more nearly native conditions.},

The absorption of radiation energy results in incremental regular changes to the crystal structure, making its impact on the process of solving the structure strongly correlated with other experimental variables. An understanding of all the dependencies is still limited and does not allow for a precise prediction of the outcome of a particular diffraction experiment. Results are presented of diffraction experiments performed under different experimental conditions.

The results show that primary radiation damage is linearly dependent on the X-ray dose even when the crystal is at cryogenic temperatures. The existence of an upper limit for the primary radiation damage was observed. Above the threshold of approximately 1 × 107 Gy, excessive damage of the crystal develops which is interpreted as the onset of secondary and/or tertiary radiation damage. This upper limit of X-ray dose is compared with Henderson's limit [Henderson (1990). Proc. R. Soc.

There have been improvements in the basic procedures such as calibration of the incident X-ray intensity and calculation of the dose likely to be deposited in a crystal of known size and composition with this intensity. There has been increased emphasis on using additional techniques such as optical, Raman or X-ray spectroscopy to complement X-ray diffraction. Apparent discrepancies between the results of different techniques can be explained by the fact that they are sensitive to different length scales or to changes in the electronic state rather than to movement of atoms. Investigations have been carried out at room temperature as well as cryo-temperatures and, in both cases, with the introduction of potential scavenger molecules. These and other studies are leading to an overall description of the changes which can occur when a protein crystal is irradiated with X-rays at both cryo- and room temperatures. Results from crystallographic and spectroscopic radiation-damage experiments can be reconciled with other studies in the field of radiation physics and chemistry.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of radiation damage (assayed by increases in atomic B factors) to thaumatin and urease crystals at temperatures ranging from 25 to 300 K is reported. The nature of the damage changes dramatically at approximately 180 K. Above this temperature the role of solvent diffusion is apparent in thaumatin crystals, as solvent-exposed turns and loops are especially sensitive. In urease, a flap covering the active site is the most sensitive part of the molecule and nearby loops show enhanced sensitivity. Below 180 K sensitivity is correlated with poor local packing, especially in thaumatin. At all temperatures, the component of the damage that is spatially uniform within the unit cell accounts for more than half of the total increase in the atomic B factors and correlates with changes in mosaicity. This component may arise from lattice-level, rather than local, disorder. The effects of primary structure on radiation sensitivity are small compared with those of tertiary structure, local packing, solvent accessibility and crystal contacts. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Specific radiation damage can be used to solve macromolecular structures using the radiation-damage-induced phasing (RIP) method. The method has been investigated for six disulfide-containing test structures (elastase, insulin, lysozyme, ribonuclease A, trypsin and thaumatin) using data sets that were collected on a third-generation synchrotron undulator beamline with a highly attenuated beam. Each crystal was exposed to the unattenuated X-ray beam between the collection of a 'before' and an 'after' data set. The X-ray 'burn'-induced intensity differences ranged from 5 to 15{\%}, depending on the protein investigated. X-ray-susceptible substructures were determined using the integrated direct and Patterson methods in SHELXD. The best substructures were found by downscaling the 'after' data set in SHELXC by a scale factor K, with optimal values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. The initial substructures were improved through iteration with SHELXE by the addition of negatively occupied sites as well as a large number of relatively weak sites. The final substructures ranged from 40 to more than 300 sites, with strongest peaks as high as 57$\sigma$. All structures except one could be solved: it was not possible to find the initial substructure for ribonuclease A, however, SHELXE iteration starting with the known five most susceptible sites gave excellent maps. Downscaling proved to be necessary for the solution of elastase, lysozyme and thaumatin and reduced the number of SHELXE iterations in the other cases. The combination of downscaling and substructure iteration provides important benefits for the phasing of macromolecular structures using radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {The primary event which occurs when an X-ray photon of energy less than 30 keV is absorbed in a protein crystal (or other organic material) is the production of a photoelectron with a similar energy to that of the absorbed photon. The electron then scatters inelastically off the surrounding material losing energy in the process. This reduction in energy takes place over track lengths of a few microm for 20 keV electrons. The vector distances between the initial and final positions of the photoelectrons are less than the track lengths owing to the non-linear tracks followed by the electrons. For crystals with smaller dimensions than the vector distances, a significant proportion of the energy could leave the crystal with the high-energy electrons. This could provide an advantage in terms of reduced radiation damage. In order to estimate the possible benefits, calculations of the electron tracks are given, initially using the continuous slowing-down approximation. A Monte Carlo approach is then used to provide more accurate values of the vector distance travelled by electrons inside a protein crystal. The calculations indicate that significant reductions in radiation damage could occur for crystals of a few microm in size. The benefits would be greater when operating at higher energies. In addition, a scheme for realising the possible benefits in a practical situation is described. This could then form the basis of trial experiments.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and online UV–visible absorption microspectrophotometry with X-ray crystallography have been used in a complementary manner to follow X-ray-induced disulfide-bond cleavage. Online UV–visible spectroscopy showed that upon X-irradiation, disulfide radicalization appeared to saturate at an absorbed dose of approximately 0.5–0.8 MGy, in contrast to the saturating dose of ∼0.2 MGy observed using EPR at much lower dose rates. The observations suggest that a multi-track model involving product formation owing to the interaction of two separate tracks is a valid model for radiation damage in protein crystals. The saturation levels are remarkably consistent given the widely different experimental parameters and the range of total absorbed doses studied. The results indicate that even at the lowest doses used for structural investigations disulfide bonds are already radicalized. Multi-track considerations offer the first step in a comprehensive model of radiation damage that could potentially lead to a combined computational and experimental approach to identifying when damage is likely to be present, to quantitate it and to provide the ability to recover the native unperturbed structure.},

abstract = {The temperature-dependence of radiation damage in macromolecular X-ray crystallography is currently much debated. Most protein crystallographic studies are based on data collected at 100 K. Data collection at temperatures below 100 K has been proposed to reduce radiation damage and above 100 K to be useful for kinetic crystallography that is aimed at the generation and trapping of protein intermediate states. Here the global and specific synchrotron-radiation sensitivity of crystalline thermolysin at 100 and 160 K are compared. Both types of damage are higher at 160 K than at 100 K. At 160 K more residue types are affected (Lys, Asp, Gln, Pro, Thr, Met, Asn) than at 100 K (Met, Asp, Glu, Lys). The X-ray-induced relative atomic B-factor increase is shown to correlate with the proximity of the atom to the nearest solvent channel at 160 K. Two models may explain the observed correlation: either an increase in static disorder or an increased attack of hydroxyl radicals from the solvent area of the crystal.},

abstract = {The resolution of X-ray diffraction microscopy is limited by the maximum dose that can be delivered prior to sample damage. In the proposed serial crystallography method, the damage problem is addressed by distributing the total dose over many identical hydrated macromolecules running continuously in a single-file train across a continuous X-ray beam, and resolution is then limited only by the available molecular and X-ray fluxes and molecular alignment. Orientation of the diffracting molecules is achieved by laser alignment. The incident X-ray fluence (energy/area) is evaluated that is required to obtain a given resolution from (i) an analytical model, giving the count rate at the maximum scattering angle for a model protein, (ii) explicit simulation of diffraction patterns for a GroEL-GroES protein complex, and (iii) the spatial frequency cut-off of the transfer function following iterative solution of the phase problem, and reconstruction of an electron density map in the projection approximation. These calculations include counting shot noise and multiple starts of the phasing algorithm. The results indicate counting time and the number of proteins needed within the beam at any instant for a given resolution and X-ray flux. An inverse fourth-power dependence of exposure time on resolution is confirmed, with important implications for all coherent X-ray imaging. It is found that multiple single-file protein beams will be needed for sub-nanometer resolution on current third-generation synchrotrons, but not on fourth-generation designs, where reconstruction of secondary protein structure at a resolution of 7 {\AA} should be possible with relatively short exposures. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2008.},

abstract = {X-ray crystal structures propel biochemistry research like no other experimental method, since they answer many questions directly and inspire new hypotheses. Unfortunately, many users of crystallographic models mistake them for actual experimental data. Crystallographic models are interpretations, several steps removed from the experimental measurements, making it difficult for nonspecialists to assess the quality of the underlying data. Crystallographers mainly rely on "global" measures of data and model quality to build models. Robust validation procedures based on global measures now largely ensure that structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are largely correct. However, global measures do not allow users of crystallographic models to judge the reliability of "local" features in a region of interest. Refinement of a model to fit into an electron density map requires interpretation of the data to produce a single "best" overall model. This process requires inclusion of most probable conformations in areas of poor density. Users who misunderstand this can be misled, especially in regions of the structure that are mobile, including active sites, surface residues, and especially ligands. This article aims to equip users of macromolecular models with tools to critically assess local model quality. Structure users should always check the agreement of the electron density map and the derived model in all areas of interest, even if the global statistics are good. We provide illustrated examples of interpreted electron density as a guide for those unaccustomed to viewing electron density.},

abstract = {X-ray damage to protein crystals is often assessed on the basis of the degradation of diffraction intensity, yet this measure is not sensitive to the rapid changes that occur at photosensitive groups such as the active sites of metalloproteins. Here, X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to study the X-ray dose-dependent photoreduction of crystals of the [Fe2S2]-containing metalloprotein putidaredoxin. A dramatic decrease in the rate of photoreduction is observed in crystals cryocooled with liquid helium at 40 K compared with those cooled with liquid nitrogen at 110 K. Whereas structural changes consistent with cluster reduction occur in the active site of the crystal measured at 110 K, no such changes occur in the crystal measured at 40 K, even after an eightfold increase in dose. When the structural results from extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements are compared with those obtained by crystallography on this and similar proteins, it is apparent that X-ray-induced photoreduction has had an impact on the crystallographic data and subsequent structure solutions. These results strongly indicate the importance of using liquid-helium-based cooling for metalloprotein crystallography in order to avoid the subtle yet important changes that can take place at the metalloprotein active sites when liquid-nitrogen-based cooling is used. The study also illustrates the need for direct measurement of the redox states of the metals, through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, simultaneously with the crystallographic measurements. {\textcopyright} International Union of Crystallography 2007.},

abstract = {In macromolecular crystallography, the acquisition of a complete set of diffraction intensities typically involves a high cumulative dose of X-ray radiation. In the process of data acquisition, the irradiated crystal lattice undergoes a broad range of chemical and physical changes. These result in the gradual decay of diffraction intensities, accompanied by changes in the macroscopic organization of crystal lattice order and by localized changes in electron density that, owing to complex radiation chemistry, are specific for a particular macromolecule. The decay of diffraction intensities is a well defined physical process that is fully correctable during scaling and merging analysis and therefore, while limiting the amount of diffraction, it has no other impact on phasing procedures. Specific chemical changes, which are variable even between different crystal forms of the same macromolecule, are more difficult to predict, describe and correct in data. Appearing during the process of data collection, they result in gradual changes in structure factors and therefore have profound consequences in phasing procedures. Examples of various combinations of radiation-induced changes are presented and various considerations pertinent to the determination of the best strategies for handling diffraction data analysis in representative situations are discussed.},

Synchrotron beamlines now exist that are capable of measuring data from single crystals that are just a few micrometres in size. This provides renewed motivation to study and understand the radiation damage behaviour of small protein crystals. Reciprocal-space mapping and Bragg coherent diffractive imaging experiments have been performed on cryo-cooled microcrystals of hen egg-white lysozyme as they undergo radiation damage. Several well established metrics, such as intensity-loss and lattice expansion, are applied to the diffraction data and the results are compared with several new metrics that can be extracted from the coherent imaging experiments. Individually some of these metrics are inconclusive. However, combining metrics, the results suggest that radiation damage behaviour in protein micro-crystals differs from that of larger protein crystals and may allow them to continue to diffract for longer. A possible mechanism to account for these observations is proposed.},

Synchrotron radiation allows for atomic resolutions but is frequently accompanied by radiation damage to protein complexes. In this study a human aldose reductase mutant complexed with a bromine-substituted inhibitor was determined to atomic resolution [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3onc]. Though the radiation dose was moderate, a selective disruption of a bromine-inhibitor bond during the experiment was observed while the protein appears unaffected. A covalent bond to bromine is cleaved and the displaced atom is not scattered throughout the crystal but can most likely be assigned as a bromide to an additional difference electron density peak observed in the structure. The bromide relocates to an adjacent unoccupied site where promising interactions to protein residues stabilize its position. These findings were verified by a second similar structure determined with considerably higher radiation dose (PDB code 3onb). {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.},

However, cryo-MX experiments suffer from the early onset of so-called specific radiation damage that affects certain amino-acid residues and, in particular, the active sites of many proteins. Here, a series of MX experiments are described which suggest that specific and global radiation damage are much less decoupled at room temperature than they are at cryogenic temperatures. The results reported here demonstrate the interest in reviving the practice of collecting MX diffraction data at room temperature and allow structural biologists to favourably envisage the development of time-resolved MX experiments at synchrotron sources.},

abstract = {Protein crystallography using synchrotron radiation sources has had a tremendous impact on biology, having yielded the structures of thousands of proteins and given detailed insight into their mechanisms. However, the technique is limited by the requirement for macroscopic crystals, which can be difficult to obtain, as well as by the often severe radiation damage caused in diffraction experiments, in particular when using tiny crystals. To slow radiation damage, data collection is typically performed at cryogenic temperatures. With the advent of free-electron lasers (FELs) capable of delivering extremely intense femtosecond X-ray pulses, this situation appears to be remedied, allowing the structure determination of undamaged macromolecules using either macroscopic or microscopic crystals. The latter are exposed to the FEL beam in random orientations and their diffraction data are collected at cryogenic or room temperature in a serial fashion, since each crystal is destroyed upon a single exposure. The new approaches required for crystal growth and delivery, and for diffraction data analysis, including de novo phasing, are reviewed. The opportunities and challenges of SFX are described, including applications such as time-resolved measurements and the analysis of radiation damage-prone systems.},

abstract = {The local Fourier-space relation between diffracted intensity I , diffraction wavevector q and dose D , $\backslash$tilde I(q,D), is key to probing and understanding radiation damage by X-rays and energetic particles in both diffraction and imaging experiments. The models used in protein crystallography for the last 50 years provide good fits to experimental I ( q ) versus nominal dose data, but have unclear physical significance. More recently, a fit to diffraction and imaging experiments suggested that the maximum tolerable dose varies as q −1 or linearly with resolution. Here, it is shown that crystallographic data have been strongly perturbed by the effects of spatially nonuniform crystal irradiation and diffraction during data collection. Reanalysis shows that these data are consistent with a purely exponential local dose dependence, $\backslash$tilde I(q,D) = I 0 ( q )exp[− D / D e ( q )], where D e ( q ) ∝ q $\alpha$ with $\alpha$ ≃ 1.7. A physics-based model for radiation damage, in which damage events occurring at random locations within a sample each cause energy deposition and blurring of the electron density within a small volume, predicts this exponential variation with dose for all q values and a decay exponent $\alpha$ ≃ 2 in two and three dimensions, roughly consistent with both diffraction and imaging experiments over more than two orders of magnitude in resolution. The B -factor model used to account for radiation damage in crystallographic scaling programs is consistent with $\alpha$ = 2, but may not accurately capture the dose dependencies of structure factors under typical nonuniform illumination conditions. The strong q dependence of radiation-induced diffraction decays implies that the previously proposed 20–30 MGy dose limit for protein crystallography should be replaced by a resolution-dependent dose limit that, for atomic resolution data sets, will be much smaller. The results suggest that the physics underlying basic experimental trends in radiation damage at T ≃ 100 K is straightforward and universal. Deviations of the local I ( q , D ) from strictly exponential behavior may provide mechanistic insights, especially into the radiation-damage processes responsible for the greatly increased radiation sensitivity observed at T ≃ 300 K.},

abstract = {Protein crystallography data collection at synchrotrons is routinely carried out at cryogenic temperatures to mitigate radiation damage. Although damage still takes place at 100 K and below, the immobilization of free radicals increases the lifetime of the crystals by approximately 100-fold. Recent studies have shown that flash-cooling decreases the heterogeneity of the conformational ensemble and can hide important functional mechanisms from observation. These discoveries have motivated increasing numbers of experiments to be carried out at room temperature. However, the trade-offs between increased risk of radiation damage and increased observation of alternative conformations at room temperature relative to cryogenic temperature have not been examined. A considerable amount of effort has previously been spent studying radiation damage at cryo-temperatures, but the relevance of these studies to room temperature diffraction is not well understood. Here, the effects of radiation damage on the conformational landscapes of three different proteins ( T. danielli thaumatin, hen egg-white lysozyme and human cyclophilin A) at room (278 K) and cryogenic (100 K) temperatures are investigated. Increasingly damaged datasets were collected at each temperature, up to a maximum dose of the order of 10 7 Gy at 100 K and 10 5 Gy at 278 K. Although it was not possible to discern a clear trend between damage and multiple conformations at either temperature, it was observed that disorder, monitored by B -factor-dependent crystallographic order parameters, increased with higher absorbed dose for the three proteins at 100 K. At 278 K, however, the total increase in this disorder was only statistically significant for thaumatin. A correlation between specific radiation damage affecting side chains and the amount of disorder was not observed. This analysis suggests that elevated conformational heterogeneity in crystal structures at room temperature is observed despite radiation damage, and not as a result thereof.},

abstract = {It is important to consider radiation damage to crystals caused by data collection when solving structures and critical when determining protein function, which can often depend on very subtle structural characteristics. In this study the rate of damage to specific sites in protein crystals cooled at 100 K is found to depend on the energy of the incident X-ray beam. Several lysozyme crystals were each subjected to 3-26 MGy of cumulative X-ray exposure by collecting multiple data sets from each crystal at either 9 keV or 14 keV. The integrated electron density surrounding each S atom in the structure was calculated for each data set and the change in electron density was evaluated as a function of dose at the two energies. The rate of electron density decrease per cubic {\AA} per MGy was determined to be greater at 14 keV than at 9 keV for cysteine sulfurs involved in disulphide bridges; no statistically significant differences in the decay rates were found for methionine sulfurs. These preliminary results imply that it might be possible to minimize certain types of specific radiation damage by an appropriate choice of energy. Further experiments studying a variety of photolabile sites over a wider range of energies are needed to confirm this conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {To investigate the effect of high-energy X-rays on site-specific radiation-damage, low-dose diffraction data were collected from radiation-sensitive crystals of the metal enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Data were collected at the Structural Biology I beamline (BL41XU) at SPring-8, using 30 keV X-rays and a highly sensitive pixel array detector equipped with a cadmium telluride sensor. The experimental setup of continuous sample translation using multiple crystals allowed the average diffraction weighted dose per data set to be reduced to 58 kGy, and the resulting data revealed a ligand structure featuring an identical bond length to that in the damage-free structure determined using an X-ray free-electron laser. However, precise analysis of the residual density around the ligand structure refined with the synchrotron data showed the possibility of a small level of specific damage, which might have resulted from the accumulated dose of 58 kGy per data set. Further investigation of the photon-energy dependence of specific damage, as assessed by variations in UV-vis absorption spectra, was conducted using an on-line spectrometer at various energies ranging from 10 to 30 keV. No evidence was found for specific radiation damage being energy dependent.},

abstract = {Traditionally small-molecule crystallographers have not usually observed or recognized significant radiation damage to their samples during diffraction experiments. However, the increased flux densities provided by third-generation synchrotrons have resulted in increasing numbers of observations of this phenomenon. The diversity of types of small-molecule systems means it is not yet possible to propose a general mechanism for their radiation-induced sample decay, however characterization of the effects will permit attempts to understand and mitigate it. Here, systematic experiments are reported on the effects that sample temperature and beam attenuation have on radiation damage progression, allowing qualitative and quantitative assessment of their impact on crystals of a small-molecule test sample. To allow inter-comparison of different measurements, radiation-damage metrics (diffraction-intensity decline, resolution fall-off, scaling B -factor increase) are plotted against the absorbed dose. For ease-of-dose calculations, the software developed for protein crystallography, RADDOSE -3 D , has been modified for use in small-molecule crystallography. It is intended that these initial experiments will assist in establishing protocols for small-molecule crystallographers to optimize the diffraction signal from their samples prior to the onset of the deleterious effects of radiation damage.},

This electronic radiation damage causes the atomic scattering factors to change, affecting, in particular, the heavy atoms, due to their higher photoabsorption cross sections. Here, it is shown that experimental serial femtosecond crystallography data collected with an extremely bright XFEL source exhibit a reduction of the effective scattering power of the sulfur atoms in a native protein.

Major problems include Coulomb repulsion within the incident beam and the need for high lateral coherence, difficulties that are discussed in terms of existing and future electron sources. Using longer pulses of electrons appears to make the attainment of near-atomic resolution more feasible, at least for nanocrystalline particles, whereas obtaining this information from single-molecule particles in an aqueous environment seems a more distant goal. We also consider the possibility of serial crystallography using a liquid jet injector with a continuous electron beam in a transmission electron microscope (TEM).},

abstract = {Radiation damage is an unwelcome and unavoidable aspect of macromolecular crystallography. In order to quantify the extent of X-ray-induced changes, knowledge of the dose (absorbed energy per unit mass) is necessary since it is the obvious metric against which to plot variables such as diffraction intensity loss and B factors. Significant improvements to the program RADDOSE for accurately calculating the dose absorbed by macromolecular crystals are presented here. Specifically, the probability of energy loss through the escape of fluorescent photons from de-excitation of an atom following photoelectric absorption is now included. For lighter elements, both the probability of fluorescence and of its subsequent escape from the crystal are negligible, but for heavier atoms the chance of fluorescence becomes significant ( e.g. 30{\%} as opposed to Auger electron decay from a K -shell excited iron atom), and this has the effect of reducing the absorbed dose. The effects of this phenomenon on dose calculations are presented for examples of crystals of an iron-containing protein, 2-selenomethionine proteins, a uranium derivatised protein, and for a nucleic acid sample. For instance, the inclusion of fluorescent escape results in up to a 27{\%} decrease in the calculated absorbed dose for a typical selenomethionine protein crystal irradiated at the selenium K -edge.},

We find that, at 12 keV (1 {\AA} wavelength), about ten absorbed photons are sufficient to "kill" a unit cell. As this corresponds to about one elastically scattered photon, each unit cell can contribute only about one photon to total Bragg diffraction.

abstract = {The majority of 3D structures of macromolecules are currently determined by macromolecular crystallography, which employs the diffraction of X-rays on single crystals. However, during diffraction experiments, the X-rays can damage the protein crystals by ionization processes, especially when powerful X-ray sources at synchrotron facilities are used. This process of radiation damage generates photo-electrons that can get trapped in protein moieties. The 3D structure derived from such experiments can differ remarkably from the structure of the native molecule. Recently, the crystal structures of different oxidation states of horseradish peroxidase and nickel-containing superoxide dismutase were determined using crystallographic redox titration performed during the exposure of the crystals to the incident X-ray beam. Previous crystallographic analyses have not shown the distinct structures of the active sites associated with the redox state of the structural features of these enzymes. These new studies show that, for protein moieties that are susceptible to radiation damage and prone to reduction by photo-electrons, care is required in both the design of the diffraction experiment and the analysis and interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

While its utility has been instrumental in progressing our knowledge of structures of molecules, it suffers from limitations such as the need for large, well-diffracting crystals, and radiation damage that can hamper native structural determination. The recent advent of X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and their implementation in the emerging field of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has given rise to a remarkable expansion upon existing crystallographic constraints, allowing structural biologists access to previously restricted scientific territory. SFX relies on exceptionally brilliant, micro-focused X-ray pulses, which are femtoseconds in duration, to probe nano/micrometer sized crystals in a serial fashion. This results in data sets comprised of individual snapshots, each capturing Bragg diffraction of single crystals in random orientations prior to their subsequent destruction. Thus structural elucidation while avoiding radiation damage, even at room temperature, can now be achieved. This emerging field has cultivated new methods for nanocrystallogenesis, sample delivery, and data processing. Opportunities and challenges within SFX are reviewed herein.},

According to radiolytic footprinting experiments, the resulting strand breaks and base modifications are inhomogeneously distributed along the DNA molecule irradiated free or bound to ligands (polyamines, thiols, proteins). A Monte-Carlo based model of simulation of the reaction of OH. radicals with the macromolecules, called RADACK, allows calculating the relative probability of damage of each nucleotide of DNA irradiated alone or in complexes with proteins. RADACK calculations require the knowledge of the three dimensional structure of DNA and its complexes (determined by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or molecular modeling). The confrontation of the calculated values with the results of the radiolytic footprinting experiments together with molecular modeling calculations show that: (1) the extent and location of the lesions are strongly dependent on the structure of DNA, which in turns is modulated by the base sequence and by the binding of proteins and (2) the regions in contact with the protein can be protected against the attack by the hydroxyl radicals via masking of the binding site and by scavenging of the radicals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Significant progress has been made in macromolecular crystallography over recent years in both the understanding and mitigation of X-ray induced radiation damage when collecting diffraction data from crystalline proteins. In contrast, despite the large field that is productively engaged in the study of radiation chemistry of nucleic acids, particularly of DNA, there are currently very few X-ray crystallographic studies on radiation damage mechanisms in nucleic acids. Quantitative comparison of damage to protein and DNA crystals separately is challenging, but many of the issues are circumvented by studying pre-formed biological nucleoprotein complexes where direct comparison of each component can be made under the same controlled conditions. Here a model protein–DNA complex C.Esp1396I is employed to investigate specific damage mechanisms for protein and DNA in a biologically relevant complex over a large dose range (2.07–44.63 MGy). In order to allow a quantitative analysis of radiation damage sites from a complex series of macromolecular diffraction data, a computational method has been developed that is generally applicable to the field. Typical specific damage was observed for both the protein on particular amino acids and for the DNA on, for example, the cleavage of base-sugar N 1 —C and sugar-phosphate C—O bonds. Strikingly the DNA component was determined to be far more resistant to specific damage than the protein for the investigated dose range. At low doses the protein was observed to be susceptible to radiation damage while the DNA was far more resistant, damage only being observed at significantly higher doses.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the concept that crystallinity is not an essential requirement for applying the techniques of X-ray crystal structure analysis. Assuming this to be true, the removal of crystallinity as a prerequisite for the techniques would allow the imaging of structures well beyond the present range of sizes accessible to X-ray crystallography. An example of an imageable structure could be a single small biological cell, containing perhaps 1013-1014 Da. The proposed concept differs from the usual diffraction method of studying noncrystalline structure, i.e. small-angle scattering, in carrying out the diffraction experiment and subsequent processing as if the structure being studied were in fact the asymmetric unit of a crystal: i.e. orienting the structure in all directions in the X-ray beam needed to explore its Fourier transform (F transform), and phasing and inverting the transform to obtain the electron-density image of the structure. The one actual difference from the crystal case is that the F transform is faint and also continuous, rather than displaying discrete intense Bragg spots. As a result, to get a readable pattern, the structure must be exposed to high levels of radiation. This last fact creates the principal limitation of the technique. With single air-dried biological cells at room temperature as diffracting specimens and soft X-rays in the wavelength range 18-32 {\AA}, patterns to date have not been observed beyond resolutions of 140-300 {\AA} before radiation damage has become evident. At this resolution, the technique nevertheless would lie on the same curve of resolution vs specimen size as do the existing major imaging techniques of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and light microscopy, falling directly between the latter two. Thus, X-ray diffractive imaging is not destroyed by the withdrawal of crystallinity but instead is shifted to a new size range of structures, which have hitherto been somewhat inaccessible to imaging. A method for phasing the diffraction pattern, based on the ability to sample the pattern more finely than in the case of the crystalline specimen, is giving good results in preliminary testing. The principal need at present is for better instrumentation for collecting the diffraction data, including the additional motions needed for collecting data in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Radiation damage to cryocooled protein crystals during x-ray structure determination has become an inherent part of macromolecular diffraction data collection at third-generation synchrotrons. Generally, radiation damage is an undesirable component of the experiment and can result in erroneous structural detail in the final model. The characterization of radiation damage thus has become an important area for structural biologists. The calculated dose limit of 2 × 107 Gy for the diffracting power of cryocooled protein crystals to drop by half has been experimentally evaluated at a third-generation synchrotron source. Successive data sets were collected from four holoferritin and three apoferritin crystals. The absorbed dose for each crystal was calculated by using the program RADDOSE after measurement of the incident photon flux and determination of the elemental crystal composition by microparticle-induced x-ray emission. Degradation in diffraction quality and specific structural changes induced by synchrotron radiation then could be compared directly with absorbed dose for different dose/dose rate regimes: a 10{\%} lifetime decrease for a 10-fold dose rate increase was observed. Remarkable agreement both between different crystals of the same type and between apoferritin and holoferritin was observed for the dose required to reduce the diffracted intensity by half (D1/2). From these measurements, a dose limit of D1/2 = 4.3 (±0.3) × 107 Gy was obtained. However, by considering other data quality indicators, an intensity reduction to IIn2 = In2 × I0, corresponding to an absorbed dose of 3.0 × 107 Gy, is recommended as an appropriate dose limit for typical macromolecular crystallography experiments. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The lifetime of a macromolecular crystal in an X-ray beam is assumed to be limited by the absorbed dose. This dose, expressed in Gray (Gy = J kg -1), is a function of a number of parameters: the absorption coefficients of the constituent atoms of the crystal, the number of molecules per asymmetric unit, the beam energy, flux, size and profile, the crystal size, and the total irradiation time. The effects of these variables on the predicted absorbed dose, calculated using the program RADDOSE, are discussed and are illustrated with reference to the irradiation of a selenomethionine protein crystal of unknown structure. The results of RADDOSE can and will in the future be used to inform the data collection procedure as it sets a theoretical upper limit on the total exposure time at a certain X-ray source. However, as illustrated with an example for which the experimental data are compared with prediction, the actual lifetime of a crystal could become shorter in those cases where specific damage breaks down crucial crystal contacts. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have the potential to revolutionize macromolecular structural biology due to the unique combination of spatial coherence, extreme peak brilliance, and short duration of X-ray pulses. A recently emerged serial femtosecond (fs) crystallography (SFX) approach using XFEL radiation overcomes some of the biggest hurdles of traditional crystallography related to radiation damage through the diffraction-before-destruction principle. Intense fs XFEL pulses enable high-resolution room-temperature structure determination of difficult-to-crystallize biological macromolecules, while simultaneously opening a new era of time-resolved structural studies. Here, we review the latest developments in instrumentation, sample delivery, data analysis, crystallization methods, and applications of SFX to important biological questions, and conclude with brief insights into the bright future of structural biology using XFELs. XFELs allow radiation damage to be overcome, enabling the determination of high-resolution room-temperature structures of difficult-to-crystallize proteins, for which only small crystals are available, and of extremely radiation-sensitive macromolecules, such as metalloenzymes. De novo phasing at XFELs has been established on several different targets and by different methods, thereby enabling the determination of the structure of novel macromolecules of biological interest. The extremely short fs duration of XFEL pulses provides access to dynamic information about unstable intermediate states and irreversible reactions. The development of new injectors, crystal delivery media, and fixed target devices has dramatically reduced the amount of required crystallized protein. Mixing injectors provide an important avenue to study biological interactions in 4D space. Developments in data-processing software have reduced the required amount of data and improved data quality.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers have opened up the possibility of structure determination of protein crystals at room temperature, free of radiation damage. The femtosecond-duration pulses of these sources enable diffraction signals to be collected from samples at doses of 1000 MGy or higher. The sample is vaporized by the intense pulse, but not before the scattering that gives rise to the diffraction pattern takes place. Consequently, only a single flash diffraction pattern can be recorded from a crystal, giving rise to the method of serial crystallography where tens of thousands of patterns are collected from individual crystals that flow across the beam and the patterns are indexed and aggregated into a set of structure factors. The high-dose tolerance and the many-crystal averaging approach allow data to be collected from much smaller crystals than have been examined at synchrotron radiation facilities, even from radiation-sensitive samples. Here, we review the interaction of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with materials and discuss the implications for structure determination. We identify various dose regimes and conclude that the strongest achievable signals for a given sample are attained at the highest possible dose rates, from highest possible pulse intensities. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The method of Monte Carlo integration over crystallite size and orientation was applied to experimental data from Photosystem I nanocrystals. This arrives at structure factors from many partial reflections without prior knowledge of the particle-size distribution. The data were collected at the Linac Coherent Light Source (the first hard-X-ray laser user facility), to which was fitted a hydrated protein nanocrystal injector jet, according to the method of serial crystallography. The data are single still diffraction snapshots, each from a different nanocrystal with sizes ranging between 100 nm and 2 $\mu$m, so the angular width of Bragg peaks was dominated by crystal-size effects. These results were compared with single-crystal data recorded from large crystals of Photosystem I at the Advanced Light Source and the quality of the data was found to be similar. The implications for improving the efficiency of data collection by allowing the use of very small crystals, for radiation-damage reduction and for time-resolved diffraction studies at room temperature are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the accurate estimation of small signals, redundancy of observations is often seen as an essential tool for the experimenter. This is particularly true during macromolecular structure determination by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD), where the exploitable signal can be less than a few percent. At the most intense undulator synchrotron beamlines, the effect of radiation damage can be such that all usable signal is obscured. Here the magnitude of this effect in experiments performed at the Se K-edge is quantified. Six successive data sets were collected on the same crystal, interspersed with two exposures to the X-ray beam during which data were not collected. It is shown that the very first data set has excellent phasing statistics, whereas these statistics degrade for the later data sets. Merging several data sets into one, highly redundant, data set only gave moderate improvements as a result of the presence of radiation damage. Part of the damage could be corrected for using a linear interpolation scheme. Interpolation of the data to a low-dose as well as to a high-dose data set allowed us to combine the SAD method with the radiation-damage induced phasing (RIP) technique, which further improved the experimental phases, especially after density modification. Some recommendations are given on how to mitigate the effect of radiation damage during structure determination. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {For the first time, protein microcrystallography has been performed with a focused synchrotron-radiation beam of 1 $\mu$m using a goniometer with a sub-micrometre sphere of confusion. The crystal structure of xylanase II has been determined with a flux density of about 3 × 1010 photons s-1 $\mu$m-2 at the sample. Two sets of diffraction images collected from different sized crystals were shown to comprise data of good quality, which allowed a 1.5 {\AA} resolution xylanase II structure to be obtained. The main conclusion of this experiment is that a high-resolution diffraction pattern can be obtained from 20 $\mu$m3 crystal volume, corresponding to about 2 × 108 unit cells. Despite the high irradiation dose in this case, it was possible to obtain an excellent high-resolution map and it could be concluded from the individual atomic B-factor patterns that there was no evidence of significant radiation damage. The photoelectron escape from a narrow diffraction channel is a possible reason for reduced radiation damage as indicated by Monte Carlo simulations. These results open many new opportunities in scanning protein microcrystallography and make random data collection from microcrystals a real possibility, therefore enabling structures to be solved from much smaller crystals than previously anticipated as long as the crystallites are well ordered. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Radiation damage is a major cause of failure in macromolecular crystallography experiments. Although it is always best to evenly illuminate the entire volume of a homogeneously diffracting crystal, limitations of the available equipment and imperfections in the sample often require a more sophisticated targeting strategy, involving microbeams smaller than the crystal, and translations of the crystal during data collection. This leads to a highly inhomogeneous distribution of absorbed X-rays (i.e., dose). Under these common experimental conditions, the relationship between dose and time is nonlinear, making it difficult to design an experimental strategy that optimizes the radiation damage lifetime of the crystal, or to assign appropriate dose values to an experiment. We present, and experimentally validate, a predictive metric diffraction-weighted dose for modeling the rate of decay of total diffracted intensity from protein crystals in macromolecular crystallography, and hence we can now assign appropriate "dose" values to modern experimental setups. Further, by taking the ratio of total elastic scattering to diffraction-weighted dose, we show that it is possible to directly compare potential data-collection strategies to optimize the diffraction for a given level of damage under specific experimental conditions. As an example of the applicability of this method, we demonstrate that by offsetting the rotation axis from the beam axis by 1.25 times the full-width half maximum of the beam, it is possible to significantly extend the dose lifetime of the crystal, leading to a higher number of diffracted photons, better statistics, and lower overall radiation damage.},

This short review gives a radiation chemical perspective on some of the physical and chemical processes that need to be considered in understanding potential pathways leading to the gradual degradation of the samples. Under the conditions used for X-ray crystallography at a temperature of {\textless}100 K in the presence of cryoprotectant agents, the majority of radiation damage of the protein samples arises from direct ionization of the amino acid residues and their associated water molecules. Some of the chemical processes that may occur at these protein centres, such as bond scission, are discussed. Several approaches are discussed that may reduce radiation damage, using agents known from radiation chemistry to minimize radical-induced degradation of the sample.},

abstract = {Radiation damage to protein crystals is the most serious problem in obtaining accurate structures from protein crystallography. In order to examine the photon energy dependence of radiation damage, 12 to 15 data sets from each of nine tetragonal lysozyme crystals were collected at nine different X-ray energies (6.5, 7.1, 8.3, 9.9, 12.4, 16.5, 20.0, 24.8 and 33.0 keV) using beamline BL41XU at SPring-8. All results were compared on the basis of absorbed dose, expressed in Gray (Gy). Crystallographic statistics, such as the values of lattice constants, Rmerge and I/$\sigma$(I), for each data set degraded at all nine energies as the exposure time for each crystal increased. In all data sets, radiation damage was observed after the absorbed dose exceeded 106 Gy. However, from the point of view of crystallographic statistics normalized to the absorbed dose, no clear dependence on photon energy was observed in these results. Structural refinement showed that the average B-factor for the last data set was larger than that for the first data set at all energies tested. However, no energy dependence of radiation damage on B-factor was found. Furthermore, disruption of disulfide bonds due to radiation damage was observed in electron density maps even at the highest photon energy (33 keV) used in this study. Therefore, these results suggest that radiation damage in the energy range investigated could be evaluated based on absorbed dose without energy dependence, and that it is important to minimize the absorbed dose in a crystal sample for obtaining an accurate protein structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

An equivalent representation of sensitivity via a single parameter, normalized half-dose, is introduced. This parameter varies by an order of magnitude between the different structures studied. The data show a correlation of crystal radiation sensitivity with crystal solvent content but no dose-rate dependency was detected in the range 0.05–300 kGy s −1 .

abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction snapshotsg are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (4200nm to 21/4m in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {A new approach for collecting data from many hundreds of thousands of microcrystals using X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser has recently been developed. Referred to as serial crystallography, diffraction patterns are recorded at a constant rate as a suspension of protein crystals flows across the path of an X-ray beam. Events that by chance contain single-crystal diffraction patterns are retained, then indexed and merged to form a three-dimensional set of reflection intensities for structure determination. This approach relies upon several innovations: an intense X-ray beam; a fast detector system; a means to rapidly flow a suspension of crystals across the X-ray beam; and the computational infrastructure to process the large volume of data. Originally conceived for radiation-damage-free measurements with ultrafast X-ray pulses, the same methods can be employed with synchrotron radiation. As in powder diffraction, the averaging of thousands of observations per Bragg peak may improve the ratio of signal to noise of low-dose exposures. Here, it is shown that this paradigm can be implemented for room-temperature data collection using synchrotron radiation and exposure times of less than 3 ms. Using lysozyme microcrystals as a model system, over 40 000 single-crystal diffraction patterns were obtained and merged to produce a structural model that could be refined to 2.1 {\AA} resolution. The resulting electron density is in excellent agreement with that obtained using standard X-ray data collection techniques. With further improvements the method is well suited for even shorter exposures at future and upgraded synchrotron radiation facilities that may deliver beams with 1000 times higher brightness than they currently produce.},

@article{Allan2013,
abstract = {An extensive radiation chemistry literature would suggest that the addition of certain radical scavengers might mitigate the effects of radiation damage during protein crystallography diffraction data collection. However, attempts to demonstrate and quantify such an amelioration and its dose dependence have not yielded consistent results, either at room temperature (RT) or 100 K. Here the information thus far available is summarized and reasons for this lack of quantitative success are identified. Firstly, several different metrics have been used to monitor and quantify the rate of damage, and, as shown here, these can give results which are in conflict regarding scavenger efficacy. In addition, significant variation in results from data collected from crystals treated in nominally the same way has been observed. Secondly, typical crystallization conditions contain substantial concentrations of chemical species which already interact strongly with some of the X-ray-induced radicals that the added scavengers are intended to intercept. These interactions are probed here by the complementary technique of on-line microspectrophotometry carried out on solutions and crystals held both at 100 K and RT, the latter enabled by the use of a beamline-mounted humidifying device. With the help of computational chemistry, attempts are made to assign some of the characteristic spectral features observed experimentally. A further source of uncertainty undoubtedly lies in the challenge of reliably measuring the parameters necessary for the accurate calculation of the absorbed dose (e.g. crystal size and shape, beam profile) and its distribution within the volume of the crystal (an issue addressed in detail in another article in this issue). While microspectrophotometry reveals that the production of various species can be quenched by the addition of scavengers, it is less clear that this observation can be translated into a significant gain in crystal dose tolerance for macromolecular crystallographers. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore-all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Radiation damage limits the accuracy of macromolecular structures in X-ray crystallography. Cryogenic (cryo-) cooling reduces the global radiation damage rate and, therefore, became the method of choice over the past decades. The recent advent of serial crystallography, which spreads the absorbed energy over many crystals, thereby reducing damage, has rendered room temperature (RT) data collection more practical and also extendable to microcrystals, both enabling and requiring the study of specific and global radiation damage at RT. Here, we performed sequential serial raster-scanning crystallography using a microfocused synchrotron beam that allowed for the collection of two series of 40 and 90 full datasets at 2- and 1.9-{\AA} resolution at a dose rate of 40.3 MGy/s on hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) crystals at RT and cryotemperature, respectively. The diffraction intensity halved its initial value at average doses ( D 1/2 ) of 0.57 and 15.3 MGy at RT and 100 K, respectively. Specific radiation damage at RT was observed at disulfide bonds but not at acidic residues, increasing and then apparently reversing, a peculiar behavior that can be modeled by accounting for differential diffraction intensity decay due to the nonuniform illumination by the X-ray beam. Specific damage to disulfide bonds is evident early on at RT and proceeds at a fivefold higher rate than global damage. The decay modeling suggests it is advisable not to exceed a dose of 0.38 MGy per dataset in static and time-resolved synchrotron crystallography experiments at RT. This rough yardstick might change for proteins other than HEWL and at resolutions other than 2 {\AA}.},

For instance, a further order of magnitude could perhaps be gained in signal to noise for general synchrotron experiments. In addition, X-ray free-electron lasers offer to capture fragments of reciprocal space without radiation damage, and open up the subpicosecond regime of protein dynamics and activity. But electrons have recently stolen the limelight: so is X-ray crystallography in rude health, or will imaging methods, especially single-particle electron microscopy, render it obsolete for the most interesting biology, whilst electron diffraction enables structure determination from even the smallest crystals?

Synchrotron Rad. 12, 299-303] examined the possibility of reduced radiation damage for small crystals (10 m and below in size) under conditions where the photoelectrons could escape from the sample. The conclusion of this paper was that higher-energy radiation (e.g. 40 keV) could offer an advantage as the photoelectron path length was greater and less energy would be deposited in the crystal. This paper refines these calculations further by including the effects of energy deposited owing to Compton scattering and the energy difference between the incident photon and the emitted photoelectron. An estimate is given for the optimum wavelength for collecting data from a protein crystal of a given size and composition. Another way of reducing radiation damage from a protein crystal is to collect data with a very short pulsed X-ray source where a single image can be obtained before subsequent radiation damage occurs. A comparison of this approach compared with the use of shorter wavelengths is made. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Union of Crystallography.},

abstract = {Radiation damage inflicted during diffraction data collection in macromolecular crystallography has re-emerged in the last decade as a major experimental and computational challenge, as even for crystals held at 100 K it can result in severe data-quality degradation and the appearance in solved structures of artefacts which affect biological interpretations. Here, the observable symptoms and basic physical processes involved in radiation damage are described and the concept of absorbed dose as the basic metric against which to monitor the experimentally observed changes is outlined. Investigations into radiation damage in macromolecular crystallography are ongoing and the number of studies is rapidly increasing. The current literature on the subject is compiled as a resource for the interested researcher.},

abstract = {With the continuing development of beamlines for macromolecular crystallography (MX) over the last few years providing ever higher X-ray flux densities, it has become even more important to be aware of the effects of radiation damage on the resulting structures. Nine papers in this issue cover a range of aspects related to the physics and chemistry of the manifestations of this damage, as observed in both MX and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on crystals, solutions and tissue samples. The reports include measurements of the heating caused by X-ray irradiation in ruby microcrystals, low-dose experiments examining damage rates as a function of incident X-ray energy up to 30 keV on a metallo-enzyme using a CdTe detector of high quantum efficiency as well as a theoretical analysis of the gains predicted in diffraction efficiency using these detectors, a SAXS examination of low-dose radiation exposure effects on the dissociation of a protein complex related to human health, theoretical calculations describing radiation chemistry pathways which aim to explain the specific structural damage widely observed in proteins, investigation of radiation-induced damage effects in a DNA crystal, a case study on a metallo-enzyme where structural movements thought to be mechanism related might actually be radiation-damage-induced changes, and finally a review describing what X-ray radiation-induced cysteine modifications can teach us about protein dynamics and catalysis. These papers, along with some other relevant literature published since the last Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Radiation Damage special issue in 2017, are briefly summarized below.},

abstract = {Xylose isomerase (XI) is an industrially important metalloprotein studied for decades. Its reaction mechanism has been postulated to involve movement of the catalytic metal cofactor to several different conformations. Here, a dose-dependent approach was used to investigate the radiation damage effects on XI and their potential influence on the reaction mechanism interpreted from the X-ray derived structures. Radiation damage is still one of the major challenges for X-ray diffraction experiments and causes both global and site-specific damage. In this study, consecutive high-resolution data sets from a single XI crystal from the same wedge were collected at 100 K and the progression of radiation damage was tracked over increasing dose (0.13–3.88 MGy). The catalytic metal and its surrounding amino acid environment experience a build-up of free radicals, and the results show radiation-damage-induced structural perturbations ranging from an absolute metal positional shift to specific residue motions in the active site. The apparent metal movement is an artefact of global damage and the resulting unit-cell expansion, but residue motion appears to be driven by the dose. Understanding and identifying radiation-induced damage is an important factor in accurately interpreting the biological conclusions being drawn.},

abstract = {Time-resolved in situ video monitoring and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy in combination with X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) have been used for the first time in a combined manner to study the effect of synchrotron radiation on a series of homogeneous aqueous copper solutions in a microreactor. This series included both non biologically relevant (pyridine, bipyridine, neocuproine, terpyridine, dimethylpyridine, ammonia, ethylenediamine, and 1,10-phenanthroline) and biologically relevant (histidine, glycine, and imidazole) ligands. It was found that when water is present as solvent, gas bubbles are formed under the influence of the X-ray beam. At the liquid-gas interface of these bubbles, in particular cases colloidal copper nanoparticles are formed. This reduction process was found to be influenced by the type of copper precursor salt (SO42-, NO 3-, and Cl-), the ligands surrounding the copper cation, and the redox potential of the copper complexes (ranging between +594 and -360 mV). In other words, in some cases, no reduction was encountered (e.g., ammonia in the presence of SO42- and NO 3-), whereas in other cases reduction to either Cu + (neocuproine with SO42-) or Cu0 (e.g., histidine and imidazole both with SO42-, NO 4-, and Cl-) was observed. These results illustrate the added value of video spectroscopy for the interpretation of in situ XANES studies. Not only do the results give an illustration of the parameters that are important in the redox processes that occur in biological systems, they also show the potential problems associated with studying catalytic processes in aqueous solutions by XANES spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Cysteine is a rare but functionally important amino acid that is often subject to covalent modification. Cysteine oxidation plays an important role in many human disease processes, and basal levels of cysteine oxidation are required for proper cellular function. Because reactive cysteine residues are typically ionized to the thiolate anion (Cys-S − ), their formation of a covalent bond alters the electrostatic and steric environment of the active site. X-ray-induced photo-oxidation to sulfenic acids (Cys-SOH) can recapitulate some aspects of the changes that occur under physiological conditions. Here we propose how site-specific cysteine photo-oxidation can be used to interrogate ensuing changes in protein structure and dynamics at atomic resolution. Although this powerful approach can connect cysteine covalent modification to global protein conformational changes and function, careful biochemical validation must accompany all such studies to exclude misleading artifacts. New types of X-ray crystallography experiments and powerful computational methods are creating new opportunities to connect conformational dynamics to catalysis for the large class of systems that use covalently modified cysteine residues for catalysis or regulation.},

However, radiation damage can effectively be reduced by utilizing the electron and radical scavenging potential of certain small-molecule compounds. We propose an approach to protect macromolecular crystals prior to data collection by quick soaking with scavengers. This, in favorable cases, can more than double crystal lifetime in the X-ray beam. The approach has the potential to yield diffraction data of superior quality and hence to increase the amount of high-quality diffraction data and of structural information attainable from a single crystal. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we review the recent progress in cryo-EM for structural studies of dynamic biological macromolecules. Scope of review We provide an overview of the cryo-EM method and introduce contemporary studies to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics, including examples from the recent literature. Major conclusions Cryo-EM is a powerful tool for the investigation of biological macromolecular structures including analysis of their dynamics by using advanced image-processing algorithms. The method has become even more widely applicable with present-day single particle analysis and electron tomography. General significance The cryo-EM method can be used to determine the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules in near native condition at close to atomic resolution, and has the potential to reveal conformations of dynamic molecular complexes.

Presented here are the results from a first successful experimental phasing study of a macromolecular crystal structure at a wavelength close to the sulfur K edge. This has been made possible by the in-vacuum setup and the long-wavelength optimised experimental setup at the I23 beamline at Diamond Light Source. In these early commissioning experiments only standard data collection and processing procedures have been applied, in particular no dedicated absorption correction has been used. Nevertheless the success of the experiment demonstrates that the capability to extract phase information can be even further improved once data collection protocols and data processing have been optimised.},

Results of intensity-loss analysis unexpectedly showed that the dose tolerated by a crystal is dependent on the dose rate according to a positive linear relationship (99{\%} correlation coefficient); a 60{\%} increase in dose rate gave a 4-fold increase in crystal lifetime over the range studied. Alternative metrics of damage were also assessed from room temperature data. In the dose-rate range tested (6 Gy s-1 to 10 Gy s-1), data collection at 100 K appears to offer a 26-113 times increase in the lifetime of the crystal. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The advent of highly intense wiggler and undulator beamlines has reintroduced the problem of X-ray radiation damage in protein crystals even at cryogenic temperatures (100 K). Although cryocrystallography can be utilized for the majority of protein crystals, certain macromolecular crystals ( e.g. of viruses) suffer large increases in mosaicity upon flash cooling and data are still collected at room temperature (293 K). An alternative mechanism to cryocooling for prolonging crystal lifetime is the use of radioprotectants. These compounds are able to scavenge the free radical species formed upon X-ray irradiation which are thought to be responsible for part of the observed damage. Three putative radioprotectants, ascorbate, 1,4-benzoquinone and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone (TEMP), were tested for their ability to prolong lysozyme crystal lifetimes at 293 K. Plots of relative summed intensity against dose were used as a metric to assess radioprotectant ability: ascorbate and 1,4-benzoquinone appear to be effective, whereas studies on TEMP were inconclusive. Ascorbate, which scavenges OH{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$bullet{\}} radicals ( k OH = 8 × 10 9 M −1 s −1 ) and electrons with a lower rate constant ( k e-(aq) = 3.0 × 10 8 M −1 s −1 ), doubled the crystal dose tolerance, whereas 1,4-benzoquinone, which also scavenges both OH{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$bullet{\}} radicals ( k OH = 1.2 × 10 9 M −1 s −1 ) and electrons ( k e-(aq) = 1.2 × 10 10 M −1 s −1 ), offered a ninefold increase in dose tolerance at the dose rates used. Pivotally, these preliminary results on a limited number of samples show that the two scavengers also induced a striking change in the dose dependence of the intensity decay from a first-order to a zeroth-order process.},

abstract = {Proteins belong to the most complex colloidal system in terms of their physicochemical properties, size and conformational-flexibility. This complexity contributes to their great sensitivity to any external change and dictate the uncertainty of crystallization. The need of 3D models to understand their functionality and interaction mechanisms with other neighbouring (macro)molecules has driven the tremendous effort put into the field of crystallography that has also permeated other fields trying to shed some light into reluctant-to-crystallize proteins. This review is aimed at revising protein crystallization from a regular-laboratory point of view. It is also devoted to highlight the latest developments and achievements to produce, identify and deliver high-quality protein crystals for XFEL, Micro-ED or neutron diffraction. The low likelihood of protein crystallization is rationalized by considering the intrinsic polypeptide nature (folded state, surface charge, etc) followed by a description of the standard crystallization methods (batch, vapour diffusion and counter-diffusion), including high throughput advances. Other methodologies aimed at determining protein features in solution (NMR, SAS, DLS) or to gather structural information from single particles such as Cryo-EM are also discussed. Finally, current approaches showing the convergence of different structural biology techniques and the cross-methodologies adaptation to tackle the most difficult problems, are presented.

abstract = {X-ray induced radiation damage of protein crystals is well known to occur even at cryogenic temperatures. Redox active sites like metal sites seem especially vulnerable for these radiation-induced reductions. It is essential to know correctly the oxidation state of metal sites in protein crystal structures to be able to interpret the structure-function relation. Through previous structural studies, we have tried to characterise and understand the reactions between myoglobin and peroxides. These reaction intermediates are relevant because myoglobin is proposed to take part as scavenger of reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress, and because these intermediates are similar among the haem peroxidases and oxygenases. We have in our previous studies shown that these different myoglobin states are influenced by the X-rays used. In this study, we have in detail investigated the impact that X-rays have on these different oxidation states of myoglobin. An underlying goal has been to find a way to be able to determine mostly unreduced states. We have by using single-crystal light absorption spectroscopy found that the different oxidation states of myoglobin are to a different extent influenced by the X-rays (e.g. ferric Fe III myoglobin is faster reduced than ferryl Fe IVO myoglobin). We observe that the higher oxidation states are not reduced to normal ferrous Fe II or ferric Fe III states, but end up in some intermediate and possibly artificial states. For ferric myoglobin, it seems that annealing of the radiation-induced/reduced state can reversibly more or less give the starting point (ferric myoglobin). Both scavengers and different dose-rates might influence to which extent the different states are affected by the X-rays. Our study shows that it is essential to do a time/dose monitoring of the influence X-rays have on each specific redox-state with spectroscopic techniques like single-crystal light absorption spectroscopy. This will determine to which extent you can collect X-ray diffraction data on your crystal before it becomes too heavily influenced/reduced by X-rays.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors. FEBS Journal published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd on behalf of FEBS. UNLABELLED: In macromolecular crystallography, the agreement between observed and predicted structure factors (Rcryst and Rfree ) is seldom better than 20{\%}. This is much larger than the estimate of experimental error (Rmerge ). The difference between Rcryst and Rmerge is the R-factor gap. There is no such gap in small-molecule crystallography, for which calculated structure factors are generally considered more accurate than the experimental measurements. Perhaps the true noise level of macromolecular data is higher than expected? Or is the gap caused by inaccurate phases that trap refined models in local minima? By generating simulated diffraction patterns using the program MLFSOM, and including every conceivable source of experimental error, we show that neither is the case. Processing our simulated data yielded values that were indistinguishable from those of real data for all crystallographic statistics except the final Rcryst and Rfree . These values decreased to 3.8{\%} and 5.5{\%} for simulated data, suggesting that the reason for high R-factors in macromolecular crystallography is neither experimental error nor phase bias, but rather an underlying inadequacy in the models used to explain our observations. The present inability to accurately represent the entire macromolecule with both its flexibility and its protein-solvent interface may be improved by synergies between small-angle X-ray scattering, computational chemistry and crystallography. The exciting implication of our finding is that macromolecular data contain substantial hidden and untapped potential to resolve ambiguities in the true nature of the nanoscale, a task that the second century of crystallography promises to fulfill.

However, it also brings with it the danger of compromising the validity of the outcomes if not done properly. The Map Challenge is a first step in assessing the state of the art and to shape future developments in data processing. The organizers presented seven cases for single particle reconstruction, and 27 members of the community responded with 66 submissions. Seven groups analyzed these submissions, resulting in several assessment reports, summarized here. We devised a range of analyses to evaluate the submitted maps, including visual impressions, Fourier shell correlation, pairwise similarity and interpretation through modeling. Unfortunately, we did not find strong trends. We ascribe this to the complexity of the challenge, dealing with multiple cases, software packages and processing approaches. This puts the user in the spotlight, where his/her choices becomes the determinant of map quality. The future focus should therefore be on promulgating best practices and encapsulating these in the software. Such practices include adherence to validation principles, most notably the processing of independent sets, proper resolution-limited alignment, appropriate masking and map sharpening. We consider the Map Challenge to be a highly valuable exercise that should be repeated frequently or on an ongoing basis.},

To achieve this goal, we report an integrative modeling approach to simultaneously determine structure and dynamics of macromolecular systems from cryo-electron microscopy density maps. By quantifying the level of noise in the data and dealing with their ensemble-averaged nature, this approach enables the integration of multiple sources of information to model ensembles of structures and infer their populations.

We developed PRIME, an algorithm part of the SIMPLE software suite, for determination of the relative 3D orientations of single-particle projection images. PRIME has primarily found use for generation of an initial ab initio 3D reconstruction. Here we show that the strategy behind PRIME, iterative estimation of per-particle orientation distributions with stochastic hill climbing, provides a competitive approach to near-atomic resolution single-particle 3D reconstruction. A number of mathematical techniques for accelerating the convergence rate are introduced, leading to a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude. We benchmarked our developments on numerous publicly available data sets and conclude that near-atomic resolution ab initio 3D reconstructions can be obtained with SIMPLE in a matter of hours, using standard over-the-counter CPU workstations.},

The data obtained through single-particle cryo-EM has recently seen a leap in resolution thanks to landmark advances in experimental and computational techniques, resulting in sub-nanometer resolution structures being obtained routinely. The remaining gap between these data and revealing the mechanisms of molecular function can be closed through hybrid modeling tools that incorporate known atomic structures into the cryo-EM data. One such tool, molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF), uses molecular dynamics simulations to combine structures from X-ray crystallography with cryo-EM density maps to derive atomic models of large biomolecular complexes. The structures furnished by MDFF can be used subsequently in computational investigations aimed at revealing the dynamics of the complexes under study. In the present work, recent applications of MDFF are presented, including the interpretation of cryo-EM data of the ribosome at different stages of translation and the structure of a membrane-curvature-inducing photosynthetic complex. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Accurate structure determination from electron density maps at 3–5 {\AA} resolution necessitates a balance between extensive global and local sampling of atomistic models, yet with the stereochemical correctness of backbone and sidechain geometries. Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF), particularly through a resolution-exchange scheme, ReMDFF, provides a robust way of achieving this balance for hybrid structure determination. Employing two high-resolution density maps, namely that of $\beta$-galactosidase at 3.2 {\AA} and TRPV1 at 3.4 {\AA} we showcase the quality of ReMDFF-generated models, comparing them against ones submitted by independent research groups for the 2015–2016 Cryo-EM Model Challenge. This comparison offers a clear evaluation of ReMDFF's strengths and shortcomings, and those of data-guided real-space refinements in general. ReMDFF results scored highly on the various metric for judging the quality-of-fit and quality-of-model. However, some systematic discrepancies are also noted employing a Molprobity analysis, that are reproducible across multiple competition entries. A space of key refinement parameters is explored within ReMDFF to observe their impact within the final model. Choice of force field parameters and initial model seem to have the most significant impact on ReMDFF model-quality. To this end, very recently developed CHARMM36m force field parameters provide now more refined ReMDFF models than the ones originally submitted to the Cryo-EM challenge. Finally, a set of good-practices is prescribed for the community to benefit from the MDFF developments.},

abstract = {While the rapid proliferation of high-resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank provides a rich set of templates for starting models, it remains the case that a great many structures both past and present are built at least in part by hand-threading through low-resolution and/or weak electron density. With current model-building tools this task can be challenging, and the de facto standard for acceptable error rates (in the form of atomic clashes and unfavourable backbone and side-chain conformations) in structures based on data with d max not exceeding 3.5 {\AA} reflects this. When combined with other factors such as model bias, these residual errors can conspire to make more serious errors in the protein fold difficult or impossible to detect. The three recently published 3.6–4.2 {\AA} resolution structures of complement C4 (PDB entries 4fxg, 4fxk and 4xam) rank in the top quartile of structures of comparable resolution both in terms of R free and MolProbity score, yet, as shown here, contain register errors in six $\beta$-strands. By applying a molecular-dynamics force field that explicitly models interatomic forces and hence excludes most physically impossible conformations, the recently developed interactive molecular-dynamics flexible fitting (iMDFF) approach significantly reduces the complexity of the conformational space to be searched during manual rebuilding. This substantially improves the rate of detection and correction of register errors, and allows user-guided model building in maps with a resolution lower than 3.5 {\AA} to converge to solutions with a stereochemical quality comparable to atomic resolution structures. Here, iMDFF has been used to individually correct and re-refine these three structures to MolProbity scores of {\textless}1.7, and strategies for working with such challenging data sets are suggested. Notably, the improved model allowed the resolution for complement C4b to be extended from 4.2 to 3.5 {\AA} as demonstrated by paired refinement.},

The dose rate ranged between ∼ 1320 Gy s(-1) and ∼ 8420 Gy s(-1) with corresponding frame rates between 1.565 Hz and 12.5 Hz. The data were analysed for global radiation damage. A previously unreported negative dose-rate effect is observed in the indicators of global radiation damage, which showed an approximately 75{\%} decrease in D(1/2) at sixfold higher dose rate. The integrated intensity decreases in an exponential manner. Sample heating that could give rise to the enhanced radiation sensitivity at higher dose rate is investigated by collecting data between crystal temperatures of 298 K and 353 K.

abstract = {Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography of protein nanocrystals using ultrashort and intense pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser has proved to be a successful method for structural determination. However, due to significant variations in diffraction pattern quality from pulse to pulse only a fraction of the collected frames can be used. Experimentally, the X-ray temporal pulse profile is not known and can vary with every shot. This simulation study describes how the pulse shape affects the damage dynamics, which ultimately affects the biological interpretation of electron density. The instantaneously detected signal varies during the pulse exposure due to the pulse properties, as well as the structural and electronic changes in the sample. Here ionization and atomic motion are simulated using a radiation transfer plasma code. Pulses with parameters typical for X-ray free-electron lasers are considered: pulse energies ranging from 10 4 to 10 7 J cm −2 with photon energies from 2 to 12 keV, up to 100 fs long. Radiation damage in the form of sample heating that will lead to a loss of crystalline periodicity and changes in scattering factor due to electronic reconfigurations of ionized atoms are considered here. The simulations show differences in the dynamics of the radiation damage processes for different temporal pulse profiles and intensities, where ionization or atomic motion could be predominant. The different dynamics influence the recorded diffracted signal in any given resolution and will affect the subsequent structure determination.},

abstract = {Specific radiation damage can be used to determine phases de novo from macromolecular crystals. This method is known as radiation-damage-induced phasing (RIP). One limitation of the method is that the dose of individual data sets must be minimized, which in turn leads to data sets with low multiplicity. A solution to this problem is to use data from multiple crystals. However, the resulting signal can be degraded by a lack of isomorphism between crystals. Here, it is shown that serial synchrotron crystallography in combination with selective merging of data sets can be used to determine high-quality phases for insulin and thaumatin, and that the increased multiplicity can greatly enhance the success rate of the experiment.},

Radiation damage to the sample was evaluated qualitatively by inspecting consecutive difference electron density maps during the course of the experiment. The nature of the radiation damage was found to be identical at both wavelengths and was localized primarily at the four disulfide bridges of PPE, the cadmium site and the two methionine residues. For a quantitative examination of the radiation damage, the decrease in the peak height of the cadmium ion in various electron density maps was exploited. Again, no significant difference in radiation damage between the two wavelengths was observed. This can be rationalized by considering the wavelength dependencies of the number of diffracted photons versus the number of absorbed photons and the energy deposited in the crystal by the latter.},

J. Appl. Cryst. 37, 513-522] and BEST [Bourenkov {\&} Popov (2010). Acta Cryst. D66, 409-419]. The results indicate that in routine practice the diffraction experiment is not yet characterized well enough to support such precise predictions, as these depend fundamentally on three interrelated variables which cannot yet be determined robustly and practically: the flux density distribution of the beam; the exact crystal volume; the sensitivity of the crystal to dose. The former two are not satisfactorily approximated from typical beamline information such as nominal beam size and transmission, or two-dimensional images of the beam and crystal; the discrepancies are particularly marked when using microfocus beams ({\textless}20 m). Empirically monitoring decay with the dataset scaling B factor (Bourenkov {\&} Popov, 2010) appears more robust but is complicated by anisotropic and/or low-resolution diffraction. These observations serve to delineate the challenges, scientific and logistic, that remain to be addressed if tools for managing radiation damage in practical data collection are to be conveniently robust enough to be useful in real time. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

The XEOL of several proteins and their constituent amino acids has been characterized using the microspectrophotometers at the Swiss Light Source and Diamond Light Source. XEOL arises primarily from aromatic amino acids, but the effects of local environment and quenching within a crystal mean that the XEOL spectrum of a crystal is not the simple sum of the spectra of its constituent parts. Upon repeated exposure to X-rays XEOL spectra decay non-uniformly, suggesting that XEOL is sensitive to site-specific radiation damage. However, rates of XEOL decay were found not to correlate to decays in diffracting power, making XEOL of limited use as a metric for radiation damage to protein crystals.},

abstract = {Radiation damage remains one of the major limitations to accurate structure determination in protein crystallography (PX). Despite the use of cryo-cooling techniques, it is highly probable that a number of the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have suffered substantial radiation damage as a result of the high flux densities of third generation synchrotron X-ray sources. Whereas the effects of global damage upon diffraction pattern reflection intensities are readily detectable, traditionally the (earlier onset) site-specific structural changes induced by radiation damage have proven difficult to identify within individual PX structures. More recently, however, development of the B Damage metric has helped to address this problem. B Damage is a quantitative, per-atom metric identifies potential sites of specific damage by comparing the atomic B -factor values of atoms that occupy a similar local packing density environment in the structure. Building upon this past work, this article presents a program, RABDAM , to calculate the B Damage metric for all selected atoms within any standard-format PDB or mmCIF file. RABDAM provides several useful outputs to assess the extent of damage suffered by an input PX structure. This free and open-source software will allow assessment and improvement of the quality of PX structures both previously and newly deposited in the PDB.},

Carboxyl groups of acidic residues (Glu, Asp) losing their definition is one of the major effects observed. Here, the susceptibilities to X-ray damage of acidic residues in tetrameric malate dehydrogenase from Haloarcula marismortui are investigated. The marked excess of acidic residues in this halophilic enzyme makes it an ideal target to determine how specific damage to acidic residues is related to their structural and chemical environment. Four conclusions are drawn. (i) Acidic residues interacting with the side-chains of lysine and arginine residues are less affected by radiation damage than those interacting with serine, threonine and tyrosine side-chains. This suggests that residues with higher pK(a) values are more vulnerable to damage than those with a lower pK(a). However, such a correlation was not found when calculated pK(a) values were inspected. (ii) Acidic side-chains located in the enzymatic active site are the most radiation-sensitive ones. (iii) Acidic residues in the internal cavity formed by the four monomers and those involved in crystal contacts appear to be particularly susceptible. (iv) No correlation was found between radiation susceptibility and solvent accessibility.},

Several nonredundant X-ray diffraction data sets were collected from three different selenomethionine (Mse) derivatized protein crystals at energies far below the absorption edge before and after exposing the crystal to ultraviolet (UV) radiation using 266 nm lasers of flux density 1.7 × 10¹⁵ photons s⁻¹ mm⁻² for 10-50 min. A detailed analysis revealed that significant changes in diffracted intensities were induced by ultraviolet irradiation whilst retaining crystal isomorphism. These intensity changes allowed the crystal structures to be solved by the radiation-damage-induced phasing (RIP) technique. Inspection of the crystal structures and electron-density maps demonstrated that covalent bonds between selenium and carbon at all sites located in the core of the proteins or in a hydrophobic environment were much more susceptible to UV radiation-induced cleavage than other bonds typically present in Mse proteins. The rapid UV radiation-induced bond cleavage opens a reliable new paradigm for phasing when no tunable X-ray source is available. The behaviour of Mse derivatives of various proteins provides novel insights and an initial basis for understanding the mechanism of selenium-specific UV radiation damage.},

abstract = {Cryocooled insulin and thaumatin crystals were irradiated in a series of alternating data collections and high-dose-rate exposures using either a vertically focused or vertically defocused beam. The main result is that the radiation damage is limited to the exposed region, which can be explained by the short range of the photoelectrons and the Auger electron cascade produced by light elements. Consequently, the unexposed angular range provides significantly improved data quality and electron density compared with previously exposed angular wedges of the crystal when a vertically focused beam is used, while no differences are observed between a fresh wedge and an exposed region for the vertically defocused beam. On the other hand, the focused beam provides higher I/$\sigma$1 ratios at high resolution than homogeneous sample illumination but also causes more rapid sample deterioration. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Circumventing radiation damage remains a major problem for X-ray macromolecular crystallography. Analysis of diffraction data collected from normal-sized cryocooled lysozyme crystals shows that the dose required to collect a data set of prescribed resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, assuming an ideally efficient detector, decreases with increasing photon energy in the investigated 6.5–33 keV range. For example, the data collection efficiency is increased by a factor of ∼8 from 8 to 33 keV. Monte Carlo simulations on lysozyme crystals in the range 5–80 keV, taking into account electron escape from samples of different size, also show a positive effect of high energy (albeit less pronounced than in experiments), especially for micrometre-sized samples, and suggest that the optimum energy range is ∼24–41 keV, depending on crystal size. The importance of counting pixel detectors with a good efficiency at high energy is underlined. Macromolecular crystallography beamlines should be modified, or purposely designed, in order to benefit from higher-energy radiation through reduction of global radiation damage, better data accuracy and extension of phasing by anomalous dispersion.},

@article{Warkentin2011,
abstract = {Can radiation damage to protein crystals be `outrun' by collecting a structural data set before damage is manifested? Recent experiments using ultra-intense pulses from a free-electron laser show that the answer is yes. Here, evidence is presented that significant reductions in global damage at temperatures above 200 K may be possible using conventional X-ray sources and current or soon-to-be available detectors. Specifically, `dark progression' (an increase in damage with time after the X-rays have been turned off) was observed at temperatures between 180 and 240 K and on timescales from 200 to 1200 s. This allowed estimation of the temperature-dependent timescale for damage. The rate of dark progression is consistent with an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 14 kJ mol-1. This is comparable to the activation energy for the solvent-coupled diffusive damage processes responsible for the rapid increase in radiation sensitivity as crystals are warmed above the glass transition near 200 K. Analysis suggests that at T = 300 K data-collection times of the order of 1 s (and longer at lower temperatures) may allow significant reductions in global radiation damage, facilitating structure solution on crystals with liquid solvent. No dark progression was observed below T = 180 K, indicating that no important damage process is slowed through this timescale window in this temperature range.},

Here, we demonstrate that serial millisecond crystallography at a synchrotron beamline equipped with high-viscosity injector and high frame-rate detector allows typical crystallographic experiments to be performed at room-temperature. Using a crystal scanning approach, we determine the high-resolution structure of the radiation sensitive molybdenum storage protein, demonstrate soaking of the drug colchicine into tubulin and native sulfur phasing of the human G protein-coupled adenosine receptor. Serial crystallographic data for molecular replacement already converges in 1,000–10,000 diffraction patterns, which we collected in 3 to maximally 82 minutes. Compared with serial data we collected at a free-electron laser, the synchrotron data are of slightly lower resolution, however fewer diffraction patterns are needed for de novo phasing. Overall, the data we collected by room-temperature serial crystallography are of comparable quality to cryo-crystallographic data and can be routinely collected at synchrotrons.},

abstract = {Metal ions and metallocofactors play important roles in a broad range of biochemical reactions. Accordingly, it has been estimated that as much as 25-50{\%} of the proteome uses transition metal ions to carry out a variety of essential functions. The metal ions incorporated within metalloproteins fulfill functional roles based on chemical properties, the diversity of which arises as transition metals can adopt different redox states and geometries, dictated by the identity of the metal and the protein environment. The coupling of a metal ion with an organic framework in metallocofactors, such as heme and cobalamin, further expands the chemical functionality of metals in biology. The three-dimensional visualization of metal ions and complex metallocofactors within a protein scaffold is often a starting point for enzymology, highlighting the importance of structural characterization of metalloproteins. Metalloprotein crystallography, however, presents a number of implicit challenges including correctly incorporating the relevant metal or metallocofactor, maintaining the proper environment for the protein to be purified and crystallized (including providing anaerobic, cold, or aphotic environments), and being mindful of the possibility of X-ray induced damage to the proteins or incorporated metal ions. Nevertheless, the incorporated metals or metallocofactors also present unique advantages in metalloprotein crystallography. The significant resonance that metals undergo with X-ray photons at wavelengths used for protein crystallography and the rich electronic properties of metals, which provide intense and spectroscopically unique signatures, allow a metalloprotein crystallographer to use anomalous dispersion to determine phases for structure solution and to use simultaneous or parallel spectroscopic techniques on single crystals. These properties, coupled with the improved brightness of beamlines, the ability to tune the wavelength of the X-ray beam, the availability of advanced detectors, and the incorporation of spectroscopic equipment at a number of synchrotron beamlines, have yielded exciting developments in metalloprotein structure determination. Here we will present results on the advantageous uses of metals in metalloprotein crystallography, including using metallocofactors to obtain phasing information, using K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy to identify metals coordinated in metalloprotein crystals, and using UV-vis spectroscopy on crystals to probe the enzymatic activity of the crystallized protein.},

abstract = {X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation (SR) has revealed the atomic structures of numerous biological macromolecules including proteins and protein complexes, nucleic acids and their protein complexes, viruses, membrane proteins and drug targets. The bright SR X-ray beam with its small divergence has made the study of weakly diffracting crystals of large biological molecules possible. The ability to tune the wavelength of the SR beam to the absorption edge of certain elements has allowed anomalous scattering to be exploited for phase determination.We review the developments at synchrotron sources and beamlines from the early days to the present time, and discuss the significance of the results in providing a deeper understanding of the biological function, the design of new therapeutic molecules and time-resolved studies of dynamic events using pump-probe techniques. Radiation damage, a problem with bright X-ray sources, has been partially alleviated by collecting data at low temperature (100 K) but work is ongoing. In the most recent development, free electron laser sources can offer a peak brightness of hard X-rays approximately 10$\backslash$n 8 times brighter than that achieved at SR sources.

abstract = {Symmetry, and in particular point group symmetry, is generally the rule for the global arrangement between subunits in homodimeric and other oligomeric proteins. The structures of fragments of tropomyosin and bovine fibrinogen are recently published examples, however, of asymmetric interactions between chemically identical chains. Their departures from strict twofold symmetry are based on simple and generalizable chemical designs, but were not anticipated prior to their structure determinations. The current review aims to improve our understanding of the structural principles and functional consequences of asymmetric interactions in proteins. Here, a survey of {\textgreater}100 diverse homodimers has focused on the structures immediately adjacent to the twofold axis. Five regular frameworks in alpha-helical coiled coils and antiparallel beta-sheets accommodate many of the twofold symmetric axes. On the basis of these frameworks, certain sequence motifs can break symmetry in geometrically defined manners. In antiparallel beta-sheets, these asymmetries include register slips between strands of repeating residues and the adoption of different side-chain rotamers to avoid steric clashes of bulky residues. In parallel coiled coils, an axial stagger between the alpha-helices is produced by clusters of core alanines. Such simple designs lead to a basic understanding of the functions of diverse proteins. These functions include regulation of muscle contraction by tropomyosin, blood clot formation by fibrin, half-of-site reactivity of caspase-9, and adaptive protein recognition in the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9. Moreover, asymmetry between chemically identical subunits, by producing multiple equally stable conformations, leads to unique dynamic and self-assembly properties.},

It is suggested that all crystals should be equally stable to X-irradiation at this temperature, as they are to electron irradiation. The calculation, which depends on the assumption that electrons and X-rays are more or less equally damaging to the structure giving rise to the diffraction at very low temperature, supports experimental observations that X-ray diffraction from protein crystals seems to last indefinitely at liquid nitrogen temperatures, even in the most powerful beams available at synchrotron X-ray sources.

abstract = {Structural biology, homology modelling and rational drug design require accurate three-dimensional macromolecular coordinates. However, the coordinates in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have not all been obtained using the latest experimental and computational methods. In this study a method is presented for automated re-refinement of existing structure models in the PDB. A large-scale benchmark with 16 807 PDB entries showed that they can be improved in terms of fit to the deposited experimental X-ray data as well as in terms of geometric quality. The re-refinement protocol uses TLS models to describe concerted atom movement. The resulting structure models are made available through the PDB{\_}REDO databank (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb{\_}redo/). Grid computing techniques were used to overcome the computational requirements of this endeavour.},

abstract = {This paper describes various components of the macromolecular crystallographic refinement program REFMAC5, which is distributed as part of the CCP4 suite. REFMAC5 utilizes different likelihood functions depending on the diffraction data employed (amplitudes or intensities), the presence of twinning and the availability of SAD/SIRAS experimental diffraction data. To ensure chemical and structural integrity of the refined model, REFMAC5 offers several classes of restraints and choices of model parameterization. Reliable models at resolutions at least as low as 4 {\AA} can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement tools such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, `jelly-body' restraints and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. REFMAC5 additionally offers TLS parameterization and, when high-resolution data are available, fast refinement of anisotropic ADPs. Refinement in the presence of twinning is performed in a fully automated fashion. REFMAC5 is a flexible and highly optimized refinement package that is ideally suited for refinement across the entire resolution spectrum encountered in macromolecular crystallography.},

abstract = {X-ray-induced chemistry modifies biological macromolecules structurally and functionally, even at cryotemperatures. The mechanisms of x-radiation damage in colored or redox proteins have often been investigated by combining X-ray crystallography with in crystallo ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Here, we used Raman microspectrophotometry to follow the onset of damage in crystalline lysozyme, notably that of disulfide bond breakage. The dose-dependent Raman spectra are consistent with a kinetic model for the rupture of disulfide bonds suggesting the rapid build up of an anionic radical intermediate. This intermediate may either revert back to the oxidized state or evolve toward protonated radical species or cleaved products. The data strongly suggest that back conversion of the anionic radical is significantly accelerated by X-rays, revealing an X-ray-induced " repair" mechanism. The possibility of X-ray-induced chemical repair is an important feature to take into account when assessing radiation damage in macromolecules. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{MacEdo2009,
abstract = {One of the first events taking place when a crystal of a metalloprotein is exposed to X-ray radiation is photoreduction of the metal centres. The oxidation state of a metal cannot always be determined from routine X-ray diffraction experiments alone, but it may have a crucial impact on the metal's environment and on the analysis of the structural data when considering the functional mechanism of a metalloenzyme. Here, UV–Vis microspectrophotometry is used to test the efficacy of selected scavengers in reducing the undesirable photoreduction of the iron and copper centres in myoglobin and azurin, respectively, and X-ray crystallography to assess their capacity of mitigating global and specific radiation damage effects. UV–Vis absorption spectra of native crystals, as well as those soaked in 18 different radioprotectants, show dramatic metal reduction occurring in the first 60 s of irradiation with an X-ray beam from a third-generation synchrotron source. Among the tested radioprotectants only potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) seems to be capable of partially mitigating the rate of metal photoreduction at the concentrations used, but not to a sufficient extent that would allow a complete data set to be recorded from a fully oxidized crystal. On the other hand, analysis of the X-ray crystallographic data confirms ascorbate as an efficient protecting agent against radiation damage, other than metal centre reduction, and suggests further testing of HEPES and 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphtoquinone as potential scavengers.},

Therefore, data are now routinely collected with the sample held at around 100K, significantly reducing secondary radiation damage, and usually resulting in higher resolution and better quality data. At synchrotron sources, the frequent observation of radiation damage even at cryotemperatures has prompted the development of exciting new experiments aimed at characterising and reducing this damage, and using it for structure determination and enzymatic studies. Current research into cryotechniques seeks to understand the basic physical and chemical processes involved in flash-cooling and radiation damage, which should eventually enable the rational optimisation of cryoprotocols.},

@article{Urzhumtseva2015,
abstract = {The resolution of a diffraction data set conveys the details that one expects to distinguish in the Fourier maps calculated with these data. For example, individual atoms in a macromolecular chain cannot be resolved in the maps calculated with 2 {\AA} resolution data sets, while they can be resolved in accurate maps calculated with 1 {\AA} resolution data. However, if a data set is incomplete its high-resolution cutoff becomes less straightforward to interpret. For instance, a Fourier map calculated using a 1 {\AA} resolution data set with many high-resolution reflections missing may rather resemble a map corresponding to 2 {\AA} resolution data. The authors have proposed a method that redefines the traditional notion of data resolution, making it more formal and general. This manuscript presents the corresponding tool, the program EFRESOL . For a data set of an arbitrary completeness, the program calculates its mean, highest and lowest effective resolutions. These values are established through the minimum distance between two point scatterers when their images are still resolved as separate peaks in the Fourier maps calculated with the given data set. Additionally, the program calculates the optical resolution, which is defined as the minimum distance for typical atoms of the structure when they are resolved in a hypothetical synthesis obtained with the given amplitudes and the exact phases if they are known. Both effective and optical resolutions show the `resolving power' of the diffraction data set.},

Furthermore, it is shown that the bandwidth of an optimized corner with three metallic posts covers a full X-band or more with very low return loss better than 40 dB. The above corners are designed using the H-plane planar circuit approach because of the planar structure in the H-plane. The validities of the design concept and procedures are confirmed by EM-simulations (HFSS), and the wideband corner with three posts is verified experimentally also.},

abstract = {In macromolecular X-ray crystallography, typical data sets have substantial multiplicity. This can be used to calculate the consistency of repeated measurements and thereby assess data quality. Recently, the properties of a correlation coefficient, CC 1/2 , that can be used for this purpose were characterized and it was shown that CC 1/2 has superior properties compared with `merging' R values. A derived quantity, CC*, links data and model quality. Using experimental data sets, the behaviour of CC 1/2 and the more conventional indicators were compared in two situations of practical importance: merging data sets from different crystals and selectively rejecting weak observations or (merged) unique reflections from a data set. In these situations controlled `paired-refinement' tests show that even though discarding the weaker data leads to improvements in the merging R values, the refined models based on these data are of lower quality. These results show the folly of such data-filtering practices aimed at improving the merging R values. Interestingly, in all of these tests CC 1/2 is the one data-quality indicator for which the behaviour accurately reflects which of the alternative data-handling strategies results in the best-quality refined model. Its properties in the presence of systematic error are documented and discussed.},

Thousands of studies describing such structures have been published in the scientific literature, and 14 Nobel prizes in chemistry or medicine have been awarded to protein crystallographers. As important as these structures are for understanding the processes that take place in living organisms and also for practical applications such as drug design, many non-crystallographers still have problems with critical evaluation of the structural literature data. This review attempts to provide a brief outline of technical aspects of crystallography and to explain the meaning of some parameters that should be evaluated by users of macromolecular structures in order to interpret, but not over-interpret, the information present in the coordinate files and in their description. A discussion of the extent of the information that can be gleaned from the coordinates of structures solved at different resolution, as well as problems and pitfalls encountered in structure determination and interpretation are also covered.},

abstract = {In recent years, number of X-ray synchrotron beam lines dedicated to collecting diffraction data from macromolecular crystals has exceeded 50. Indeed, today most protein and nucleic acid crystal structures are solved and refined based on the synchrotron data. Collecting diffraction data on a synchrotron beam line involves many technical points, but it is not a mere technicality. Even though the available hardware and software have become more advanced and user-friendly, it is always beneficial if the experimenter is aware of the problems involved in the data collection process and can make informed decisions leading to the highest possible quality of the acquired diffraction data. Various factors, important for the success of data collection experiments and their relevance for different kinds of applications, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The number of macromolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank now approaches 100,000, with the vast majority of them determined by crystallographic methods. Thousands of papers describing such structures have been published in the scientific literature, and 20 Nobel Prizes in chemistry or medicine have been awarded for discoveries based on macromolecular crystallography. New hardware and software tools have made crystallography appear to be an almost routine (but still far from being analytical) technique and many structures are now being determined by scientists with very limited experience in the practical aspects of the field. However, this apparent ease is sometimes illusory and proper procedures need to be followed to maintain high standards of structure quality. In addition, many noncrystallographers may have problems with the critical evaluation and interpretation of structural results published in the scientific literature. The present review provides an outline of the technical aspects of crystallography for less experienced practitioners, as well as information that might be useful for users of macromolecular structures, aiming to show them how to interpret (but not overinterpret) the information present in the coordinate files and in their description.

abstract = {Structure determinations for biological macromolecules that have no known structural antecedents typically involve the incorporation of heavier atoms than those found natively in biological molecules. Currently, selenomethionyl proteins analyzed using single- or multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD or MAD) data predominate for such de novo analyses. Naturally occurring metal ions such as zinc or iron often suffice in MAD or SAD experiments, and sulfur SAD has been an option since it was first demonstrated using crambin 30 years ago; however, SAD analyses of structures containing only light atoms ( Z max ≤ 20) have not been common. Here, robust procedures for enhancing the signal to noise in measurements of anomalous diffraction by combining data collected from several crystals at a lower than usual X-ray energy are described. This multi-crystal native SAD method was applied in five structure determinations, using between five and 13 crystals to determine substructures of between four and 52 anomalous scatterers ( Z ≤ 20) and then the full structures ranging from 127 to 1200 ordered residues per asymmetric unit at resolutions from 2.3 to 2.8 {\AA}. Tests were devised to assure that all of the crystals used were statistically equivalent. Elemental identities for Ca, Cl, S, P and Mg were proven by f ′′ scattering-factor refinements. The procedures are robust, indicating that truly routine structure determination of typical native macromolecules is realised. Synchrotron beamlines that are optimized for low-energy X-ray diffraction measurements will facilitate such direct structural analysis.},

abstract = {Radiation damage is an unavoidable obstacle in X-ray crystallographic data collection for macromolecular structure determination, so it is important to know how much radiation a sample can endure before being degraded beyond an acceptable limit. In the literature, the threshold at which the average intensity of all recorded reflections decreases to a certain fraction of the initial value is called the `dose limit'. The first estimated D 50 dose-limit value, at which the average diffracted intensity was reduced to 50{\%}, was 20 MGy and was derived from observing sample decay in electron-diffraction experiments. A later X-ray study carried out at 100 K on ferritin protein crystals arrived at a D 50 of 43 MGy, and recommended an intensity reduction of protein reflections to 70{\%}, D 70 , corresponding to an absorbed dose of 30 MGy, as a more appropriate limit for macromolecular crystallography. In the macromolecular crystallography community, the rate of intensity decay with dose was then assumed to be similar for all protein crystals. A series of diffraction images of cryocooled (100 K) thaumatin crystals at identical small, 2° rotation intervals were recorded at X-ray energies of 6.33 , 12.66 and 19.00 keV. Five crystals were used for each wavelength. The decay in the average diffraction intensity to 70{\%} of the initial value, for data extending to 2.45 {\AA} resolution, was determined to be about 7.5 MGy at 6.33 keV and about 11 MGy at the two higher energies.},

abstract = {Radiation damage impedes macromolecular diffraction experiments. Alongside the well known effects of global radiation damage, site-specific radiation damage affects data quality and the veracity of biological conclusions on protein mechanism and function. Site-specific radiation damage follows a relatively predetermined pattern, in that different structural motifs are affected at different dose regimes: in metal-free proteins, disulfide bonds tend to break first followed by the decarboxylation of aspartic and glutamic acids. Even within these damage motifs the decay does not progress uniformly at equal rates. Within the same protein, radiation-induced electron density decay of a particular chemical group is faster than for the same group elsewhere in the protein: an effect known as preferential specific damage. Here, B Damage , a new atomic metric, is defined and validated to recognize protein regions susceptible to specific damage and to quantify the damage at these sites. By applying B Damage to a large set of known protein structures in a statistical survey, correlations between the rates of damage and various physicochemical parameters were identified. Results indicate that specific radiation damage is independent of secondary protein structure. Different disulfide bond groups (spiral, hook, and staple) show dissimilar radiation damage susceptibility. There is a consistent positive correlation between specific damage and solvent accessibility.},

Here we used specific x-ray damage during temperature-controlled crystallographic experiments at a third-generation synchrotron source to trigger and monitor (Shoot-and-Trap) structural changes putatively involved in an enzymatic reaction. In particular, a nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue of acetylcholinesterase, the "off-switch" at cholinergic synapses, was radiocleaved within the buried enzymatic active site. Subsequent product clearance, observed at 150 K but not at 100 K, indicated exit from the active site possibly via a "backdoor." The simple strategy described here is, in principle, applicable to any enzyme whose structure in complex with a substrate analogue is available and, therefore, could serve as a standard procedure in kinetic crystallography studies.},

@article{Taylor2010,
abstract = {When collecting X-ray diffraction data from a crystal, we measure the intensities of the diffracted waves scattered from a series of planes that we can imagine slicing through the crystal in all directions. From these intensities we derive the amplitudes of the scattered waves, but in the experiment we lose the phase information; that is, how we offset these waves when we add them together to reconstruct an image of our molecule. This is generally known as the `phase problem'. We can only derive the phases from some knowledge of the molecular structure. In small-molecule crystallography, some basic assumptions about atomicity give rise to relationships between the amplitudes from which phase information can be extracted. In protein crystallography, these ab initio methods can only be used in the rare cases in which there are data to at least 1.2 {\AA} resolution. For the majority of cases in protein crystallography phases are derived either by using the atomic coordinates of a structurally similar protein (molecular replacement) or by finding the positions of heavy atoms that are intrinsic to the protein or that have been added (methods such as MIR, MIRAS, SIR, SIRAS, MAD, SAD or combinations of these). The pioneering work of Perutz, Kendrew, Blow, Crick and others developed the methods of isomorphous replacement: adding electron-dense atoms to the protein without disturbing the protein structure. Nowadays, methods from small-molecule crystallography can be used to find the heavy-atom substructure and the phases for the whole protein can be bootstrapped from this prior knowledge. More recently, improved X-ray sources, detectors and software have led to the routine use of anomalous scattering to obtain phase information from either incorporated selenium or intrinsic sulfurs. In the best cases, only a single set of X-ray data (SAD) is required to provide the positions of the anomalous scatters, which together with density-modification procedures can reveal the structure of the complete protein.},

abstract = {Structure determination using X-ray crystallography involves collection of diffraction data, determination of initial phases followed by iterative rounds of model building and crystallographic refinement to improve the phases and minimize the differences between calculated and observed structure factors. At each of these stages, a variety of statistical filters exist to ensure appropriate validation. Biologically important observations often come from interpretations of signals that need to be carefully deciphered from noise, and therefore human intervention is as important as the automated methods and filters. Currently, all structural data are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and this repository is continuously evolving to incorporate new developments in macromolecular crystallography. The journals that publish data arising from structural studies modulate their policies to take cognizance of new improved methodologies. Together, the PDB and journals have evolved an accepted protocol to ensure the integrity of crystallographic results. As a result, the quality of available data and associated interpretations have improved over the years. Typically, if there are differences regarding the mechanism of action of a protein revealed by crystallography then new experiments are carried out to provide further evidence for or against a particular hypothesis. Hence, the scientific systems in structural biology are robust and to a large extent capable of correcting any errors in interpretation of structural results. However, this process is hindered by spurious challenges to published research, based on misuse of validation mechanisms. Such activities are counterproductive and will cause damage to the field of structural biology. {\textcopyright} 2017 IUBMB Life, 2017.},

Simple criteria have been sought to study the effects systematically. The unit-cell volume of protein crystals shows a linear increase with absorbed dose and has therefore been proposed to be such a measure. This paper demonstrates that the increase is sample dependent, and thus it might not be a useful indicator when comparing different samples. For individual samples, however, the increase can be used to quantify ambient temperature and dose-rate effects. In this study, highly absorbing cubic crystals of holoferritin have been used to accurately determine how cell volume changes with absorbed dose. The experiments show that, for this protein, a dose-rate effect exists and that trapped radicals can be mobilized at ca 180 K.},

The application of high-fluency X-ray sources to large biomolecules has increased the importance of finding ways to curtail the onset of X-ray-induced damage. A significant effort has been under way with the aim of identifying strategies for protecting protein structure. A comprehensive model is presented that has the potential to explain, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the structural changes induced in crystalline protein at ∼100 K. The first step is to consider the qualitative question: what are the radiation-induced intermediates and expected end products?

abstract = {X-ray-radiation-induced alterations to protein structures are still a severe problem in macromolecular crystallography. One way to avoid the influence of radiation damage is to reduce the X-ray dose absorbed by the crystal during data collection. However, here it is demonstrated using the example of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) that even a low dose of less than 0.06 MGy may induce structural alterations in proteins. This dose is about 500 times smaller than the experimental dose limit which should ideally not be exceeded per data set ( i.e. 30 MGy) and 20 times smaller than previously detected specific radiation damage at the bR active site. To date, it is the lowest dose at which radiation modification of a protein structure has been described. Complementary use was made of high-resolution X-ray crystallography and online microspectrophotometry to quantitatively study low-dose X-ray-induced changes. It is shown that structural changes of the protein correlate with the spectroscopically observed formation of the so-called bR orange species. Evidence is provided for structural modifications taking place at the protein active site that should be taken into account in crystallographic studies which aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of bR function.},

Here, the X-ray-induced reduction of the three heme proteins myoglobin, cytochrome P450cam and chloroperoxidase has been followed by on-line UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. All three systems showed a very rapid reduction of the heme iron. In chloroperoxidase the change of the ionization state from ferric to ferrous heme is associated with a movement of the heme-coordinating water molecule. The influence of the energy of the incident X-ray photons and of the presence of scavengers on the apparent reduction rate of ferric myoglobin crystals was analyzed.},

@article{Borek2018,
abstract = {A method of analysis is presented that allows for the separation of specific radiation-induced changes into distinct components in real space. The method relies on independent component analysis (ICA) and can be effectively applied to electron density maps and other types of maps, provided that they can be represented as sets of numbers on a grid. Here, for glucose isomerase crystals, ICA was used in a proof-of-concept analysis to separate temperature-dependent and temperature-independent components of specific radiation-induced changes for data sets acquired from multiple crystals across multiple temperatures. ICA identified two components, with the temperature-independent component being responsible for the majority of specific radiation-induced changes at temperatures below 130 K. The patterns of specific temperature-independent radiation-induced changes suggest a contribution from the tunnelling of electron holes as a possible explanation. In the second case, where a group of 22 data sets was collected on a single thaumatin crystal, ICA was used in another type of analysis to separate specific radiation-induced effects happening on different exposure-level scales. Here, ICA identified two components of specific radiation-induced changes that likely result from radiation-induced chemical reactions progressing with different rates at different locations in the structure. In addition, ICA unexpectedly identified the radiation-damage state corresponding to reduced disulfide bridges rather than the zero-dose extrapolated state as the highest contrast structure. The application of ICA to the analysis of specific radiation-induced changes in real space and the data pre-processing for ICA that relies on singular value decomposition, which was used previously in data space to validate a two-component physical model of X-ray radiation-induced changes, are discussed in detail. This work lays a foundation for a better understanding of protein-specific radiation chemistries and provides a framework for analysing effects of specific radiation damage in crystallographic and cryo-EM experiments.},

In systems when the metal donor (D) is well separated from the acceptor (A) by polypeptide chains, the transferring electron is presumed to be bonded, in part, by these chains, which may influence the pathway taken. This situation can be probed by radiolytic injection of electrons into proteins at low temperatures. One aim of this brief review is to consider how information derived from such radiolysis studies, and followed by ESR spectroscopy, may possibly impinge on studies of D A systems. Electrons can also be injected into duplex DNA in this way, and the results are compared with those for proteins. They are also considered in the light of recent studies of D-A electron-transfer via a polynucleotide strand. It seems that such transfers are very efficient, and it is tentatively suggested that Nature may also use this conductivity in some as yet undiscovered systems.},

The large number of structures determined each year not only reflects the impact of X-ray crystallography on many disciplines in the biological and medical fields but also its accessibility to non-expert laboratories. Thus protein crystallography is now largely a mainstream research technique and is routinely integrated in high-throughput pipelines such as structural genomics projects and structure-based drug design. Yet, significant frontiers remain that continuously require methodological developments. In particular, membrane proteins, large assemblies, and proteins from scarce natural sources still represent challenging targets for which obtaining the large diffracting crystals required for classical crystallography is often difficult. These limitations have fostered the emergence of microcrystallography, novel approaches in structural biology that collectively aim at determining structures from the smallest crystals.

abstract = {Radiation damage is the major impediment for obtaining structural information from biological samples by using ionizing radiation such as x-rays or electrons. The knowledge of underlying processes especially at cryogenic temperatures is still fragmentary, and a consistent mechanism has not been found yet. By using a combination of single-crystal x-ray diffraction, small-angle scattering, and qualitative and quantitative radiolysis experiments, we show that hydrogen gas, formed inside the sample during irradiation, rather than intramolecular bond cleavage between non-hydrogen atoms, is mainly responsible for the loss of high-resolution information and contrast in diffraction experiments and microscopy. The experiments that are presented in this paper cover a temperature range between 5 and 160 K and reveal that the commonly used temperature in x-ray crystallography of 100 K is not optimal in terms of minimizing radiation damage and thereby increasing the structural information obtainable in a single experiment. At 50 K, specific radiation damage to disulfide bridges is reduced by a factor of 4 compared to 100 K, and samples can tolerate a factor of 2.6 and 3.9 higher dose, as judged by the increase of R(free) values of elastase and cubic insulin crystals, respectively.},

abstract = {Background: Exposure of biomacromolecules to ionising radiation results in damage that is initiated by free radicals and progresses through a variety of mechanisms. A widely used technique to study the three-dimensional structures of biomacromolecules is crystallography, which makes use of ionising X-rays. It is crucial to know to what extent structures determined using this technique might be biased by the inherent radiation damage. Results: The consequences of radiation damage have been investigated for three dissimilar proteins. Similar results were obtained for each protein, atomic B factors increase, unit-cell volumes increase, protein molecules undergo slight rotations and translations, disulphide bonds break and decarboxylation of acidic residues occurs. All of these effects introduce non-isomorphism. The absorbed dose in these experiments can be reached during routine data collection at undulator beamlines of third generation synchrotron sources. Conclusions: X-rays can leave a 'fingerprint' on structures, even at cryogenic temperatures. Serious non-isomorphism can be introduced, thus hampering multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing methods. Specific structural changes can occur before the traditional measures of radiation damage have signalled it. Care must be taken when assigning structural significance to features that might easily be radiation-damage-induced changes. It is proposed that the electron-affinic disulphide bond traps electrons that migrate over the backbone of the protein, and that the sidechains of glutamic acid and aspartic acid donate electrons to nearby electron holes and become decarboxylated successively. The different disulphide bonds in each protein show a clear order of susceptibility, which might well relate to their intrinsic stability.},

Disulfide bridges break, and carboxyl groups of acidic residues lose their definition. Highly exposed carboxyls, and those in the active site of both enzymes, appear particularly susceptible. The catalytic triad residue, His-440, in acetylcholinesterase, also appears to be much more sensitive to radiation damage than other histidine residues. Our findings have direct practical implications for routine x-ray data collection at high-energy synchrotron sources. Furthermore, they provide a direct approach for studying the radiation chemistry of proteins and nucleic acids at a detailed, structural level and also may yield information concerning putative 'weak links' in a given biological macromolecule, which may be of structural and functional significance.},

abstract = {The high intensity of third-generation X-ray sources, along with the development of cryo-cooling of protein crystals at temperatures around 100 K, have made it possible to extend the diffraction limit of crystals and to reduce their size. However, even with cryo-cooled crystals, radiation damage becomes a limiting factor. So far, the radiation damage has manifested itself in the form of a loss of overall diffracted intensity and an increase in the temperature factor. The structure of a protein (myrosinase) after exposure to different doses of X-rays in the region of 20 x 1015 photons mm-2 has been studied. The changes in the structure owing to radiation damage were analysed using Fourier difference maps and occupancy refinement for the first time. Damage was obvious in the form of breakage of disulfide bonds, decarboxylation of aspartate and glutamate residues, a loss of hydroxyl groups from tyrosine and of the methylthio group of methionine. The susceptibility to radiation damage of individual groups of the same kind varies within the protein. The quality of the model resulting from structure determination might be compromised owing to the presence of radiolysis in the crystal after an excessive radiation dose. Radiation-induced structural changes may interfere with the interpretation of ligand-binding studies or MAD data. The experiments reported here suggest that there is an intrinsic limit to the amount of data which can be extracted from a sample of a given size.},
